# Expectation as a Degenerate Metric

## Purpose

This document formalizes **expectation** as a structural object within bounded execution systems. It treats expectation neither as a psychological state nor a moral claim, but as an **implicit evaluative interface** that coordinates behavior under constraint. The goal is to specify:

* what expectations *are* structurally,
* why they emerge,
* where they fail,
* and how they differ from executable metrics.

This document is **descriptive and diagnostic**, not normative. It does not prescribe values, goals, or social rules. It maps constraints.

---

## Executive Summary (Compressed)

Expectation is a **degenerate metric class**: a low-cost evaluative compression that binds execution **without explicit closure, failure semantics, or refusal symmetry**. Expectations coordinate behavior cheaply under margin, but become structurally incoherent under drift, irreversibility, or asymmetric load. Most resentment, moralization, and agency laundering arise when expectations are treated as non-metric facts rather than hidden evaluative interfaces.

---

## Position in the Load-Bearing Stack

Expectation sits between:

* **Regime 4 — Execution Closure** (compression for repetition)
* **Regime 5 — Metrics as Executable Interfaces** (binding evaluation to closure)

Expectation appears **when closure is needed but metrics are not yet explicit**.

It is a *proto-metric*: it performs evaluative work, but denies that it does so.

---

## Structural Definition

**Expectation** is an implicit evaluative compression that:

* presumes a closure without declaring it,
* assigns responsibility without locating load,
* binds behavior without specifying refusal conditions,
* and enforces retrospectively through narrative rather than prospectively through execution.

Formally:

> Expectation is a metric-like interface that binds execution while remaining unarticulated, non-finite, and non-failing.

---

## Expectation vs Proper Metrics

A proper metric (per the stack) must:

* encode explicit degrees of freedom,
* be finite and resource-bounded,
* fail explicitly when misapplied,
* bind only within a declared closure,
* make saturation visible,
* preserve refusal semantics.

Expectation systematically violates these requirements.

| Property          | Proper Metric | Expectation |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Closure           | Explicit      | Assumed     |
| Scope             | Declared      | Implicit    |
| Horizon           | Finite        | Unbounded   |
| Failure semantics | Explicit      | Silent      |
| Saturation        | Detectable    | Masked      |
| Refusal           | Executable    | Moralized   |
| Redesign path     | Locatable     | Obscured    |

Expectation therefore behaves like a **metric without safety rails**.

---

## Why Expectations Exist

Expectation is not accidental or irrational. It exists because it is:

* cheap to transmit,
* fast to apply,
* socially scalable,
* and conflict-avoiding in the short term.

Expectation emerges when:

* coordination pressure exists,
* but explicit closure would be costly or contentious,
* or metrics cannot yet be agreed upon,
* or power asymmetries make explicit binding unnecessary for one party.

In these cases, expectation functions as **informal closure**.

---

## Expectations as Compression

Expectation compresses by:

* discarding scope distinctions (when, where, how long),
* collapsing horizon distinctions (short-term vs long-term),
* ignoring topology (where cost accumulates),
* suppressing refusal paths.

This compression is lossy but executable — *temporarily*.

---

## Drift Sensitivity

Expectations are extremely drift-sensitive.

Because they:

* remain narratively stable,
* do not fail explicitly,
* and are rarely revisited unless conflict erupts,

drift manifests as:

* resentment,
* surprise blame,
* moral escalation,
* or sudden rupture.

The expectation did not “break”; it silently became invalid.

---

## Irreversibility and Retrospective Binding

Expectations bind **after execution**, not before.

Typical pattern:

1. Action occurs under implicit assumptions.
2. Outcome diverges.
3. Expectation is invoked retroactively.
4. Responsibility is assigned without prior agency.

This produces **agency laundering**:

* load is real,
* control was absent,
* agency is asserted after the fact.

---

## Asymmetric Expectations

Expectations often bind asymmetrically.

Common asymmetries:

* One party carries irreversible cost; the other retains exit.
* One party’s refusal is catastrophic; the other’s is cheap.
* One party is evaluated; the other is interpretive authority.

In stack terms:

> Expectation often violates the **symmetry requirement for agency attribution**.

---

## Why Expectations Feel Moral

Expectations feel moral because they:

* bind without explicit execution paths,
* lack redesign interfaces,
* and enforce via social sanction rather than system failure.

When a metric fails, it triggers redesign.
When an expectation fails, it triggers **judgment**.

Expectation is evaluation pretending not to be evaluation.

## Expectation Failure Modes (Structural)

### 1. Silent Saturation

Expectation accumulates load until collapse, without signaling limits.

### 2. Horizon Mismatch

Short-term expectations destroy long-term viability.

### 3. Load Obfuscation

Cost is borne privately while responsibility is narrated publicly.

### 4. Refusal Collapse

Refusal exists formally but is non-executable.

### 5. Moralization Spiral

As execution fails, discourse escalates instead of redesign.

---

## Diagnostic Tests

### Test 1 — Is this an expectation or a metric?

Ask:

* Is scope explicit?
* Is failure detectable before collapse?
* Is refusal executable without catastrophe?

If no → expectation.

---

### Test 2 — Where does load land?

Ask:

* Who absorbs irreversible cost when the expectation is unmet?

If unclear → load is being hidden.

---

### Test 3 — What is the redesign boundary?

Ask:

* When and how can this expectation be renegotiated *before* failure?

If answer is “when it becomes a problem” → too late.

---

## When Expectations Are Structurally Unavoidable

Expectations are unavoidable when:

* metrics are impossible or unethical,
* domains are high-trust and low-legibility,
* early exploration is ongoing,
* or margin is temporarily abundant.

They are *provisional tools*, not stable interfaces.

---

## Upgrading Expectations to Metrics (Safely)

Expectation can be made safer by:

* bounding scope explicitly,
* declaring horizon and duration,
* making refusal legitimate,
* attaching early failure signals,
* locating load transparently.

This converts expectation → executable interface.

---

## Values as Residue of Expectation Collapse

When expectations persist through repetition and depletion, they harden into:

* norms,
* customs,
* values.

Values are not inputs. They are **what survived irreversible compression**.

---

## Closing Compression

Expectation is not a belief or a feeling. It is a structural shortcut.

It coordinates cheaply when margin exists, but becomes dangerous when:

* environments drift,
* execution becomes irreversible,
* or refusal symmetry disappears.

Understanding expectation as a degenerate metric allows:

* resentment to be diagnosed,
* agency laundering to be detected,
* and redesign to occur *before* collapse.

Only metrics that fail loudly preserve viability over long horizons.
