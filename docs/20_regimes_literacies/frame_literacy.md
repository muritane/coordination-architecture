# Frame Literacy  
## Notes on Assumptions, Premise Collapse, and Acting Without Argument

---

## Status and Intent

This document describes **frame literacy** as a structural capability in social,
bureaucratic, and coordination systems.

Frame literacy is not:
- rhetorical skill,
- debate technique,
- persuasion,
- social intelligence in the usual sense,
- or norm compliance.

It is the ability to **identify, enter, exit, and invalidate frames** deliberately,
with awareness of executional cost.

The perspective is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological or moral.

---

## Core Claim

Most social interaction occurs **inside frames that are treated as given**.

Frame literacy is the capacity to:
- recognize those frames,
- understand what they presuppose,
- and decide whether to operate *within* them or *dissolve* them.

This choice is consequential.
It determines where cost lands.

---

## What Is a Frame? (Operational)

In this document, a **frame** refers to:

> a set of implicit assumptions that define  
> what objects exist,  
> what questions are meaningful,  
> what responses are acceptable,  
> and how coordination proceeds.

A frame is not a belief.
It is an **interaction contract**.

Examples:
- “You have a bank account → provide transactions.”
- “We share a goal → negotiate tradeoffs.”
- “You are responsible → explain yourself.”

Frames precede argument.
Argument happens *inside* them.

---

## Frames vs Facts

Facts do not determine frames.

Frames determine:
- which facts are requested,
- which facts are legible,
- and which facts are ignored.

Providing correct information **inside a false frame**
does not correct the frame.

Frame literacy distinguishes:
- supplying information,
from:
- correcting premises.

---

## Operating Modes

Frame literacy enables three distinct modes of action.

---

### 1. Frame Compliance

You accept the frame and respond within it.

Characteristics:
- low friction,
- high predictability,
- preserves discretion,
- may require mild distortion or omission.

This is the default social mode.

---

### 2. Frame Negotiation

You remain inside the frame but challenge:
- interpretations,
- exceptions,
- or boundaries.

Characteristics:
- moderate friction,
- argument and clarification,
- relies on shared language and authority.

Most “reasonable discussion” lives here.

---

### 3. Frame Invalidation

You respond by showing that:
- a key assumption does not hold,
- an object does not exist,
- or the frame no longer applies.

Characteristics:
- high friction,
- low discretion,
- forces system update,
- bypasses argument entirely.

This is rare and often experienced as “difficult,”
even when correct.

---

## Frame Invalidation Is Not Refusal

Frame invalidation differs from refusal.

Refusal says:
> “I will not comply.”

Invalidation says:
> “The condition for compliance is false.”

This removes:
- negotiation,
- justification,
- and moral framing.

What remains is **state update**.

Systems are not optimized for this.

---

## Why Frame Invalidation Feels Annoying

Frame invalidation is costly because it:

- breaks interaction flow,
- removes interpretive flexibility,
- forces upstream correction,
- shifts work to the system,
- and exposes hidden assumptions.

Annoyance is a signal of **unexpected coordination cost**,
not bad intent.

---

## Frame Literacy vs Social Skill

High social skill often means:
- staying inside frames,
- smoothing over mismatches,
- preserving ambiguity.

High frame literacy often means:
- collapsing ambiguity,
- removing negotiation,
- forcing explicitness.

The two can be in tension.

Frame literacy is **not antisocial**,
but it is **anti-deference to invalid premises**.

---

## Frames as Compression

Frames function as:
- cognitive shortcuts,
- coordination compressors,
- cost-saving abstractions.

They are efficient until:
- environments drift,
- objects disappear,
- or assumptions expire.

Frame literacy is the ability to detect **expired frames**.

---

## Risks of Frame Invalidation

Frame invalidation is not always the right move.

It is risky when:
- the system cannot update cheaply,
- the interface lacks authority,
- enforcement is rigid,
- or non-conforming responses are penalized regardless of correctness.

Correctness does not guarantee safety.

Frame literacy includes knowing **when not to invalidate**.

---

## Frame Literacy and Power

Frame literacy grants a specific kind of power:

- not dominance,
- not influence,
- not persuasion,

but **the ability to avoid arguing inside false premises**.

This power:
- reduces internal contradiction,
- preserves coherence,
- but often reduces access and goodwill.

It trades smoothness for correctness.

---

## Frame Literacy and Viability

Frame literacy supports long-horizon viability by:

- preventing silent assumption accumulation,
- avoiding wasted negotiation,
- enabling early redesign,
- and preserving refusal symmetry.

However, it increases short-horizon friction.

This is a structural trade-off.

---

## Minimal Indicators of Frame Literacy

An agent exhibits frame literacy when they can:

- identify the assumption behind a request,
- decide whether to accept it,
- invalidate it without moral escalation,
- tolerate annoyance without defensiveness,
- and absorb reduced discretion as cost.

These indicators are rare but sufficient.

---

## Closing

Frames are not lies.
They are conveniences.

Frame literacy is not about rejecting them,
but about knowing **when they no longer apply**.

Most systems prefer:
- prolonged negotiation inside broken frames,
to:
- early premise collapse.

Frame literacy reverses that preference.

It does not make interaction easier.
It makes it **honest under execution**.
