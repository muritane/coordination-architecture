# Load-Bearing Stack
## A constraint-mapping account of bounded execution

> **Purpose**  
> Specify the **structural preconditions** under which claims about action, evaluation, agency, responsibility, optimization, and governance are *well-formed* for bounded executors operating in irreversible, drifting environments.

This document is a **constraint map** for systems where:

- execution is **irreversible**,
- resources (including **energy**) are **bounded**,
- environments are **non-stationary** (drift),
- repeated action must remain **viable** across time.

It is **not** a theory of:

- psychology, cognition, or consciousness,
- intent, motivation, or preference formation,
- morality, legitimacy, justice, or fairness,
- goal selection or optimization procedures.

It does not tell you what *should* be done.  
It tells you when a claim is **coherent**, and when it is structurally ill-posed.

---

## How to use this document

Use the stack as a **validator**:

- If a claim violates a primitive constraint, it is undefined (not “wrong,” but structurally incoherent).
- If a claim collapses a critical separation, it will systematically produce failure under pressure.
- Treat “regimes” as **coexisting interfaces**, not a maturity ladder.

The stack is a *type system* for action: it rules out ill-typed statements about execution.

## Glossary (operational)

- **Executor** — any system that selects actions affecting state under bounded resources and irreversibility.
- **Execution** — state-changing action whose consequences propagate through coupled state.
- **Irreversibility** — acting eliminates alternatives and destroys information; reversal requires additional execution and cost.
- **Drift** — regime change over time; invariants are provisional and horizon-bound.
- **Compression** — discarding distinctions to remain executable under bounds; always lossy.
- **Margin** — slack in time, energy, attention, bandwidth, or capacity that permits buffering, deviation, or redesign.
- **Closure** — deliberate termination of interpretation over selected distinctions to enable repeated execution.
- **Settlement** — closure that persists through repetition and depletion and becomes enforced by failure, not preference.
- **Metric** — a finite executable interface encoding degrees of freedom retained within a closure.
- **Topology** — how execution consequences propagate (latency, fan-out, buffers, observability, irreversibility gradients, energy dissipation/recovery).
- **Horizon** — the timescale over which viability is evaluated.
- **Decidable boundary** — a pre-execution region where both acceptance and refusal are executable paths with known failure semantics.
- **Discretion** — in-execution adjustment within a closure.
- **Agency (structural)** — attribution coherent only at decidable boundaries.
- **Responsibility (structural)** — attribution of **load location** within topology, not moral blame.

## Primitive constraints (non-optional)

These are not values or design preferences.  
They are invariants of **bounded execution**.

1) **Execution is irreversible**  
Acting commits resources, destroys information, and eliminates alternatives.

2) **Resources are bounded**  
Time, energy, attention, sensing, and modeling capacity are finite.

3) **Environments drift**  
Apparent invariants are conditional, regime-dependent, and horizon-specific.

4) **Compression is unavoidable**  
Feasible execution requires discarding distinctions; lossless abstraction is impossible.

5) **Viability precedes optimization**  
“Improvement” is undefined unless continued execution remains possible.

Any framework that presumes reversibility, infinite resources, stationary environments, or lossless abstraction is **not describing bounded execution**.

---

## Critical separations (must not collapse)

Persistent failure arises when these distinctions are conflated:

- **Execution vs interpretation** — what changes state vs what explains/justifies it
- **Existence vs persistence vs scale** — emergence vs endurance vs reuse
- **Exploration vs exploitation vs redesign** — option generation vs cheap repetition vs reopening distinctions
- **Regulation vs control** — low-cost background closure vs costly adaptive intervention
- **Discretion vs agency** — adjustment under execution vs boundary-level choice
- **Evaluation vs optimization** — judgment signals vs executable objective pursuit

These regimes may coexist in different subsystems.  
The stack exists to keep them articulated under constraint.

# The stack (constraint map)

## Regime 0 — Existence
**Existence** means a coherent execution pattern persists long enough for its consequences to propagate beyond immediate interaction.

Existence requires:

- coupling to lower-layer dynamics,
- internal constraints that channel execution,
- resistance to immediate decoherence under disturbance.

Existence does **not** require intention, optimization, awareness, or recognition.

Evidence of existence is **causal propagation**, not narrative description.

---

## Regime 1 — Coordination pressure
**Coordination pressure** arises whenever:

- multiple executors affect shared or coupled state,
- execution is irreversible and bounded,
- information is partial or asymmetric,
- failure carries non-trivial cost.

Under these conditions, independent execution becomes unsafe.

Coordination pressure is not chosen; it is an emergent consequence of coupling.

### Displacement and masking
Coordination pressure may be:

- buffered (slack, storage, latency),
- subsidized (external absorption of cost),
- displaced (exported to other subsystems),
- masked (deferred via metrics or narratives).

Apparent absence of pressure often indicates **displacement**, not resolution.

---

## Regime 2 — Optionality preservation
Where coordination pressure has not yet bound locally **and margin remains sufficient**:

- interpretation remains open,
- deviation is cheap,
- failures are local and mostly reversible,
- information is preserved rather than destroyed.

This regime is **not optimization**.  
Evaluation here is heuristic, context-rich, and non-comparable.

Optionality is conditional: it disappears when margin collapses and can reappear only where margin is restored (sandboxes, exception paths, redesign zones).

---

## Regime 3 — Consequence topology and horizons
Execution propagates through topology defined by:

- latency,
- fan-out,
- buffering,
- observability,
- irreversibility gradients,
- energy dissipation and recovery.

Interpretation does not propagate.  
Intent does not propagate.  
Only execution persists.

### Horizons
A horizon specifies the timescale over which viability is assessed.

Topology + horizon determine:

- where disturbance appears,
- where it accumulates or dissipates,
- where it becomes invisible,
- which failures become dominant.

Most systems operate across **multiple incompatible horizons**.  
Which horizon binds execution is itself a **closure decision**, explicit or implicit.

---

## Regime 4 — Execution closure
As coordination pressure increases or margin shrinks, maintaining open interpretation becomes unsafe.

**Closure** is the deliberate discarding of distinctions so that repeated execution remains viable.

Closure is:

- domain-specific,
- role-specific,
- horizon-specific,
- margin-dependent.

Distinctions are discarded not because they are false, but because they are no longer executable.

### Closure surface area
Closures vary by:

- **extent** — how many degrees of freedom are collapsed,
- **coupling** — how many subsystems depend on the closure,
- **reversibility cost** — difficulty of reopening distinctions.

Large-extent, high-coupling, high-cost closures are primary sources of brittleness and downstream coercion-like dynamics (structural, not moral).

---

## Regime 4.1 — Settlement
A closure becomes **settled** when it:

- survives repeated execution,
- remains sufficient across relevant horizons,
- persists under depletion,
- eliminates alternatives through failure rather than choice.

At settlement:

- distinctions cease to appear as options,
- constraints feel descriptive rather than imposed,
- disagreement occurs within the representation, not about it.

Stability sustained mainly by buffering or subsidy is **not** genuine local sufficiency.

---

## Regime 5 — Metrics as executable interfaces
After closure, evaluation must coordinate execution.

**Metrics** are finite executable interfaces that encode compressed distinctions.

A metric is execution-real only if it:

- retains minimally sufficient degrees of freedom for viability,
- is bounded and computable,
- yields determinate outcomes,
- is substitutable within its regime,
- **fails explicitly** when saturated or misapplied.

Metrics do not encode truth or values.  
They encode what must remain fixed for viability over a horizon.

Values that do not bind compression remain interpretive and execution-inert.

---

## Regime 6 — Decidable boundaries and agency
Agency is coherent only at **decidable boundaries**, prior to execution.

A boundary is decidable when:

- acceptance and refusal are both executable paths,
- consequences are bounded relative to the horizon,
- failure semantics are known,
- interruptibility exists,
- margin makes refusal executable.

### Structural symmetry (refusal symmetry)
Agency attribution requires **symmetry of refusal** at the boundary.

If one party can refuse without catastrophic loss and another cannot, attributing agency to the constrained party for the coupled outcome is structurally invalid **for that boundary**.

Inside execution, actors exercise **discretion**, not agency.

---

## Regime 7 — Responsibility as load attribution
Responsibility here means **where load lands** in the topology.

Responsibility can be coherently assigned only when:

- coordination pressure exists,
- closure is in effect,
- metrics are bounded and executable,
- entry was decidable,
- outcomes depend on controllable variables within the closure.

Absent these conditions, responsibility claims are rhetorical rather than structural.

---

## Regulation vs control
Viable systems separate:

- **Regulation** — settled, low-cost background execution over closed distinctions.
- **Control** — costly, adaptive intervention near redesign boundaries.

Regulation absorbs the known.  
Control confronts the unknown.

Coordination artifacts route pressure; they do not eliminate it.

---

## Threshold independence
Three thresholds are independent:

- **Exist** — coherent execution emerges.
- **Persist** — execution survives disturbance and depletion.
- **Scale** — execution becomes a reusable building block.

A system may cross any subset without the others.

---

## Complementarity
Complementarity is structural gap-filling under constraint.

It is not automatically cooperation or alignment.  
It produces a new composite topology that may enable existence or persistence while masking fragility via dependency.

---

## Compression, drift, redesign
Because environments drift, all compression is provisional.

Systems cycle through:

1) optionality preservation,  
2) closure,  
3) exploitation,  
4) redesign.

Redesign reopens discarded distinctions.

Redesign authority cannot be fully encoded in settled metrics, because metrics encode the closure being revised.

Redesign authority resides at interruptible boundaries where failure is containable.

Failure to redesign when invariants break is a primary collapse mode.

---

## Where values appear
Values appear through irreversible compression:

- which distinctions were discarded,
- when they were discarded,
- where redesign authority resides,
- what survived depletion.

Values are not injected.  
They are residues of abstraction that survived execution.

---

## Closing (compressed)
Execution destroys information.  
Topology routes consequence.  
Energy bounds optionality.  
Compression enables repetition.  
Closure hardens into settlement.  
Metrics bind evaluation to closure.  
Agency exists only at decidable boundaries.  
Responsibility follows load in topology.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
