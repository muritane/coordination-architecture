# Decidability, Degrees of Freedom, and Agency in Load-Bearing Systems  
## A Structural Account of Boundary Consent, Constraint Binding, and Participation

---

## Status

This document provides a **structural and architectural account of agency** in load-bearing systems.

Agency is treated as a **topological property of boundary decisions under constraint**, not as:

- a psychological capacity,
- an expression of preference,
- a moral quality,
- a claim about intent or virtue,
- or a narrative of resistance.

The account is **descriptive, mechanical, and non-normative**.  
It specifies when agency exists, when it does not, and when claims of responsibility assignment are structurally coherent.

---

## Scope and Level of Abstraction

This document operates at the level of **system topology, interfaces, and execution boundaries**, not lived experience or moral evaluation.

It applies to any domain that:

- coordinates independent executors,
- allocates shared resources,
- substitutes operators or evaluators,
- propagates failure across boundaries,
- or commits irreversible action under load.

Examples include hardware interfaces, protocols, markets, institutions, evaluation systems, regulatory regimes, and governance structures.

---

## Core Definition

**Agency** is defined as:

> the capacity to make a **binding accept/refuse decision** at a **declared boundary** of a **load-bearing substrate**, with explicit knowledge of the constraints, interfaces, invariants, and failure semantics that will apply upon entry.

Agency is not freedom from constraint.  
Agency is **decidability over which constraints one binds oneself to**.

---

## What This Document Does Not Claim

This document does **not**:

- assert that all participation is voluntary,
- deny coercion, asymmetry, or domination,
- justify existing power arrangements,
- equate consent with fairness or legitimacy,
- moralize compliance or refusal,
- assume exit is always available,
- or claim systems are just.

It makes a single structural claim:

> **Binding participation requires a real, declared boundary decision.**

---

## The Structural Claim

In load-bearing systems:

> **Agency exists at boundaries, not inside execution.**

Once an executor crosses a boundary and enters execution:

- interpretation terminates,
- declared invariants apply,
- routing rules hold,
- buffer ownership is fixed,
- failure semantics bind,
- renegotiation is no longer admissible.

Behavior inside execution is not agency.  
It is **execution under bound constraints**.

---

## Decidability as the Minimal Form of Agency

Agency reduces to **decidability**:

- the ability to accept,
- the ability to refuse,
- with **known and bounded consequences** for each.

Anything less is not agency.  
Anything more belongs to exploration or negotiation.

A boundary is **not decidable** if:

- refusal carries unbounded or undefined cost,
- constraints are implicit or revealed post-entry,
- interfaces are underspecified,
- failure semantics are retroactive,
- or obligations expand after commitment.

Decidability is a **minimal structural requirement** for agency in load-bearing contexts.  
It is not a complete account of human action or autonomy.

---

## Participation as Topological Binding

To participate in a load-bearing substrate is to bind oneself to:

- declared interfaces,
- enforced invariants,
- specified inputs and outputs,
- explicit buffer ownership,
- authority and escalation paths,
- known failure and refusal semantics.

This binding is **structural**, not interpersonal.

Participation is a contract with the **topology**, not with individual actors or intentions.

---

## Degrees of Freedom as the Operator of Agency

Decidability is meaningless unless the system declares **which degrees of freedom collapse at entry**.

A system can claim agency-valid consent **only** if it explicitly classifies the task-relevant degrees of freedom at the boundary.

### Degree-of-Freedom Classes at Entry

For any load-bearing task, degrees of freedom fall into the following classes.

#### Essential Degrees of Freedom
- Fixed at entry.
- Required for correctness and substitutability.
- Enforced during execution.
- Not open to reinterpretation.

Essential degrees of freedom define what participation *is*.

---

#### Optional Degrees of Freedom
- Delegated at entry within declared bounds.
- Variation is permitted only within scope.
- Control responsibility is explicitly assigned.

Optional degrees of freedom preserve agency **only when declared**.

---

#### Latent Degrees of Freedom
- Explicitly preserved for future regimes.
- Non-binding in the current execution context.
- Activated only through version change.

Latent degrees of freedom preserve adaptability across time.

---

#### Irrelevant Degrees of Freedom
- Declared non-contributory.
- Explicitly collapsed.
- Excluded from outcome disputes.

---

#### Unknown Degrees of Freedom
- Not yet characterized.
- Excluded from responsibility attribution.
- Kept outside load-bearing execution.

Unknown degrees of freedom cannot ground consent or blame.

---

## Agency-Grade Boundary Declaration

A boundary supports agency **if and only if** it declares:

1. Which degrees of freedom are **Essential** and fixed at entry.
2. Which are **Optional** and delegated.
3. Which are **Latent** and versioned.
4. Which are **Irrelevant** and collapsed.
5. Which are **Unknown** and excluded.

If this partition is absent, misleading, or unstable, **agency is not present**, regardless of narrative choice.

---

## Hardware as a Canonical Illustration

A hardware interface provides a mechanical example.

- A component selects a standard (e.g. a memory generation).
- By doing so, it binds itself to:
  - voltage levels,
  - timing constraints,
  - signaling protocols,
  - error behavior,
  - compatibility limits.

Insertion is the act of agency.

After insertion:

- Essential degrees of freedom are fixed,
- renegotiation is impossible,
- refusal manifests as non-function.

This is not punishment.  
It is **topological incompatibility**.

---

## Markets and Institutions as Load-Bearing Substrates

Markets, standards bodies, and institutions function analogously when structurally hygienic.

Participation binds an actor to:

- specification requirements,
- compliance thresholds,
- liability assignment,
- buffer ownership (capital, time, inventory),
- evaluation and refusal mechanisms.

When degrees of freedom are explicit:

- entry is meaningful,
- responsibility is legible,
- failure is localized.

When degrees of freedom are implicit:

- agency is retroactively asserted,
- responsibility is moralized,
- buffers are silently captured.

---

## Structural False-Agency Patterns

### Post-Hoc Reinterpretation

> “I agreed, but not to *this* consequence.”

Structurally:

- an Essential degree of freedom fixed at entry is being reclassified after execution,
- interpretation is being reopened after topology hardened.

This is admissible only in exploratory regimes.

In load-bearing execution, it is a **denial of topology**, not an exercise of agency.

---

### Coerced Entry Disguised as Choice

> “You are free to refuse, but refusal carries unlimited penalty.”

Here:

- refusal semantics are unbounded,
- Essential degrees of freedom are undeclared,
- the system is already load-bearing while presenting itself as exploratory.

This is not agency.  
It is forced participation with narrative cover.

---

## Responsibility Without Moralization

Under this account:

- responsibility is not blame,
- responsibility is **load location**.

Responsibility is coherently assignable only for outcomes that depend on degrees of freedom that were:

1. Declared Essential or Optional at entry, and  
2. Within the executor’s assigned control scope.

If harm arises from:

- Unknown degrees of freedom,
- misclassified degrees of freedom,
- latent degrees of freedom that later collapse,
- or misrepresented constraints,

then responsibility was misrouted.

No moral language is required to establish this.

---

## Constraint Discovery and the End of Negotiation

Constraint discovery explains **when** invariants become unavoidable under load.

Agency explains **who is legitimately bound once they do**.

Constraint discovery without decidability produces coercion.  
Decidability without constraint discovery produces illusion.

Negotiation belongs **before entry**.  
Execution belongs **after**.

---

## Exit, Versioning, and Temporal Agency

Agency across time requires more than entry.  
It requires **bounded exit or versioning**.

Healthy systems declare:

- compatibility horizons,
- end-of-life timelines,
- migration paths,
- which degrees of freedom may change and when.

Versioning allows:

- Essential degrees of freedom to reclassify,
- consent to be refreshed rather than fossilized,
- specialization to remain time-bounded.

Without versioning:

- latent degrees of freedom collapse silently,
- consent becomes permanent,
- participation becomes entrapment.

---

## Summary (Compressed)

- Agency is boundary decidability.
- Decidability requires explicit degree-of-freedom classification.
- Participation binds to topology, not intent.
- Inside execution, reinterpretation is invalid.
- Responsibility follows declared control.
- Coercion is undeclared load-bearing entry.
- Versioning preserves agency across time.
- Moral language often substitutes for missing boundaries.

---

## Closing

Agency is not freedom from constraint.

It is the capacity to choose **which constraints to bind oneself to**,  
under **explicit degrees of freedom**,  
with **honest refusal semantics**,  
before execution begins.

Load-bearing systems do not eliminate agency.  
They require it to be **explicit, bounded, and mechanically real**.
