# Expectation as a Degenerate Metric  
## Implicit Evaluation, Asymmetric Binding, and Structural Failure Under Load

---

## Status and Intent

This document specifies **expectation** as a structural object within bounded execution systems.

Expectation is treated neither as a psychological state nor a moral claim, but as an **implicit evaluative interface** that coordinates behavior under constraint.

The purpose is to make explicit:

- what expectations are structurally,
- why they emerge,
- where they fail,
- and how they differ from executable metrics.

The account is **descriptive and diagnostic**, not normative.  
It maps constraints; it does not prescribe values or behavior.

---

## Core Claim (Compressed)

Expectation is a **degenerate metric class**:  
a low-cost evaluative compression that binds execution **without explicit closure, failure semantics, or refusal symmetry**.

Expectations coordinate cheaply while margin exists.  
Under drift, irreversibility, or asymmetric load, they become structurally incoherent.

Most resentment, moralization, and agency laundering arise when expectations are treated as background facts rather than **hidden evaluative interfaces**.

---

## Position in the Load-Bearing Stack

Expectation occupies the gap between:

- **Execution Closure** (compression for repetition), and
- **Metrics as Executable Interfaces** (explicit evaluative binding).

Expectation appears when:

- closure is functionally required,
- but metrics are not yet articulated, enforceable, or politically tolerable.

Structurally, expectation is a **proto-metric**:  
it performs evaluative work while denying that it does so.

---

## Structural Definition

**Expectation** is an implicit evaluative compression that:

- presumes a closure without declaring it,
- assigns responsibility without locating load,
- binds behavior without specifying refusal conditions,
- and enforces retrospectively through narrative rather than prospectively through execution.

Formally:

> Expectation is a metric-like interface that binds execution while remaining unarticulated, non-finite, and non-failing.

---

## Expectation vs Executable Metrics

An executable metric must:

- encode explicit degrees of freedom,
- be finite and resource-bounded,
- fail explicitly when saturated or misapplied,
- bind only within a declared closure,
- preserve refusal semantics,
- expose redesign boundaries.

Expectation violates each requirement.

| Property                | Executable Metric | Expectation |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Closure                | Explicit          | Assumed     |
| Scope                  | Declared          | Implicit    |
| Horizon                | Finite            | Unbounded   |
| Failure semantics      | Explicit          | Silent      |
| Saturation             | Detectable        | Masked     |
| Refusal                | Executable        | Moralized  |
| Redesign boundary      | Locatable         | Obscured   |

Expectation behaves like a **metric without safety rails**.

---

## Why Expectations Exist

Expectation is not accidental or irrational.

It persists because it is:

- cheap to transmit,
- fast to apply,
- socially scalable,
- and conflict-avoiding in the short term.

Expectation emerges when:

- coordination pressure exists,
- explicit closure would be costly or contentious,
- metrics are unavailable or premature,
- power asymmetries allow one party to bind without exposure.

In these contexts, expectation functions as **informal closure**.

---

## Expectation as Compression

Expectation compresses executional complexity by:

- discarding scope distinctions (when, where, how much),
- collapsing horizon distinctions (short-term vs long-term),
- ignoring consequence topology (where cost accumulates),
- suppressing refusal paths.

This compression is lossy but temporarily executable.

Its failure is deferred, not prevented.

---

## Drift Sensitivity

Expectations are highly sensitive to drift.

Because they:

- remain narratively stable,
- lack explicit failure signals,
- and are rarely renegotiated proactively,

environmental change manifests as:

- resentment,
- surprise blame,
- moral escalation,
- or abrupt rupture.

The expectation did not “break.”  
It silently became invalid.

---

## Irreversibility and Retroactive Binding

Expectations bind **after execution**, not before.

Typical pattern:

1. Action occurs under implicit assumptions.
2. Outcomes diverge.
3. Expectation is invoked retroactively.
4. Responsibility is assigned without prior agency.

This produces **agency laundering**:

- load is real,
- control was absent,
- agency is asserted post hoc.

---

## Asymmetric Expectations

Expectations frequently bind asymmetrically.

Common asymmetries include:

- one party bears irreversible cost; the other retains exit,
- one party’s refusal is catastrophic; the other’s is cheap,
- one party is evaluated; the other holds interpretive authority.

Structurally:

> Expectation often violates the **symmetry requirement for agency attribution**.

---

## Why Expectations Feel Moral

Expectations feel moral because they:

- bind without explicit execution paths,
- lack redesign interfaces,
- enforce via social sanction rather than system failure.

When a metric fails, it triggers redesign.  
When an expectation fails, it triggers **judgment**.

Expectation is evaluation pretending not to be evaluation.

## Structural Failure Modes

### 1. Silent Saturation

Load accumulates without signaling until collapse occurs.

---

### 2. Horizon Mismatch

Short-horizon expectations degrade long-horizon viability.

---

### 3. Load Obfuscation

Cost is borne privately while responsibility is narrated publicly.

---

### 4. Refusal Collapse

Refusal exists formally but is non-executable in topology.

---

### 5. Moralization Spiral

As execution fails, discourse escalates instead of redesign.

---

## Diagnostic Tests

### Test 1 — Metric or Expectation?

Ask:

- Is scope explicit?
- Does failure signal before collapse?
- Is refusal executable without catastrophe?

If not → expectation.

---

### Test 2 — Load Location

Ask:

- Who absorbs irreversible cost when the expectation is unmet?

If unclear → load is being hidden.

---

### Test 3 — Redesign Boundary

Ask:

- When and how can this be renegotiated *before* failure?

If the answer is “when it becomes a problem” → too late.

---

## When Expectations Are Structurally Unavoidable

Expectations are unavoidable when:

- metrics are impossible or unethical,
- domains are high-trust and low-legibility,
- early exploration is ongoing,
- margin is temporarily abundant.

In these cases, expectations are **provisional tools**, not stable interfaces.

---

## Upgrading Expectations Safely

Expectation can be made safer by:

- bounding scope explicitly,
- declaring horizon and duration,
- legitimizing refusal,
- attaching early failure signals,
- locating load transparently.

This converts expectation into an **executable evaluative interface**.

---

## Values as Residue

When expectations survive repetition and depletion, they harden into:

- norms,
- customs,
- values.

Values are not inputs.  
They are **what remains after irreversible compression**.

---

## Closing

Expectation is not a belief or a feeling.

It is a **structural shortcut** that coordinates cheaply while margin exists.

Under drift, irreversibility, or refusal asymmetry, it becomes dangerous.

Understanding expectation as a degenerate metric allows:

- resentment to be diagnosed,
- agency laundering to be detected,
- and redesign to occur *before collapse*.

Only evaluative interfaces that **fail loudly** preserve viability over long horizons.
