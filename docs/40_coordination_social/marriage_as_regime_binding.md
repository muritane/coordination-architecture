# Marriage as a Regime Binding
## On Marriage as Joint Execution Under Irreversible Constraint

---

## Status and intent

This document specifies **what marriage is and is not** under bounded physical and social execution.

It does **not** define marriage morally, romantically, or culturally.  
It does **not** assume permanence, virtue, or success.

It treats marriage as a **regime-binding operation** that alters reachability,
cost distribution, and irreversibility over time.

All claims are made under:

- finite time,
- finite recovery,
- irreversible actions,
- asymmetric failure costs.

No metaphysical claims are made.

---

## Core claim (compressed)

> **Marriage is a regime-binding contract that merges two execution graphs into one, introducing partial irreversibility and shared feasibility.**

Love may motivate entry.
Structure determines persistence.
Silence determines collapse.

---

## What marriage is not

Marriage is **not**:

- proof of love,
- a happiness guarantee,
- an optimization of romance,
- protection from failure,
- evidence of maturity,
- a solution to incompatibility.

None of these survive execution under constraint.

---

## What marriage actually does

Marriage performs three structural operations:

1. **Feasibility merging**  
   Two individual reachability spaces partially collapse into one.

2. **Cost coupling**  
   Certain costs (financial, emotional, reputational, legal) become jointly borne.

3. **Irreversibility introduction**  
   Exit paths narrow; some state transitions cannot be undone.

Nothing else is guaranteed.

---

## Marriage as regime binding

Before marriage:
- futures branch independently,
- refusal is cheap,
- redesign is easy,
- exit preserves agency.

After marriage:
- futures are entangled,
- refusal is socially and legally expensive,
- redesign requires joint consent,
- exit destroys some reachable states permanently.

Marriage therefore **changes kinematics**, not just incentives.

---

## Non-optional preconditions (kinematics)

The following must be checked *before* regime binding.
They are not preferences.
They are feasibility constraints.

Failure in any one produces late, irreversible collapse.

---

### 1. Risk tolerance alignment

Risk tolerance is revealed only under loss.

Questions of structure:
- How does each party behave under uncertainty?
- Is ambiguity tolerated or denied?
- Is instability faced or externalized?

Mismatch guarantees asymmetric buffer burn.

---

### 2. Feasibility honesty

A viable marriage requires:

- the ability to say “this is infeasible,”
- tolerance for refusal without moralization,
- willingness to redesign instead of escalating effort.

If infeasibility must be absorbed silently by one party,
the system is unstable by construction.

---

### 3. Recovery behavior

Failure is inevitable.
Recovery behavior determines survival.

Key distinctions:
- repair vs blame,
- learning vs repetition,
- buffer preservation vs depletion.

Marriage magnifies poor recovery into structural damage.

---

### 4. Authority and decision topology

Every joint system has decision rules.

They must be explicit:

- Who decides under disagreement?
- How are deadlocks resolved?
- Is authority procedural, emotional, or implicit?

Hidden authority produces late enforcement failure.

---

### 5. Irreversibility thresholds

Marriage enables irreversible bindings:

- children,
- debt,
- geography,
- caregiving obligations,
- legal exposure.

These must be:
- explicit,
- consensual,
- time-aware.

Irreversibility without shared consent is not commitment.
It is constraint imposition.

---

## What is optional (optimization layer)

The following affect quality, not feasibility:

- shared interests,
- aesthetic alignment,
- personality symmetry,
- lifestyle preferences,
- romantic style,
- sexual optimization.

They matter.
They do not rescue structural failure.

Over-optimizing these while ignoring kinematics is a common error.

---

## Love: what it is and what it is not

Love exists.

Under execution, love functions as:

- an attentional bias,
- a bonding accelerator,
- a patience extender,
- a motivation amplifier.

Love does **not**:

- expand reachability,
- override irreversibility,
- guarantee recovery,
- redeem infeasibility.

Love reduces *perceived* cost.
It does not alter kinematics.

---

## Narrative decay and the love myth

The narrative “love conquers all” evolved under:

- shorter lifespans,
- rigid roles,
- enforced endurance,
- external constraint.

Under modern conditions:
- long horizons,
- high volatility,
- high agency,
- weak enforcement,

the narrative no longer matches execution.

Narratives decay when they mispredict cost.

---

## The modern failure pattern

Most failures follow this sequence:

1. Love initiates coupling
2. Feasibility is not articulated
3. Marriage binds regimes
4. Infeasibility is absorbed silently
5. Buffers deplete
6. Articulation occurs under crisis
7. Exit destroys shared futures

This is an ordering error, not a moral one.

---

## Articulation timing

> **Early articulation is socially uncomfortable and structurally cheap.  
Late articulation is socially unavoidable and structurally catastrophic.**

Marriage increases buffer size.
Buffers delay detection.
They do not prevent violation.

---

## Why silence persists

Silence persists because it:

- preserves romance short-term,
- avoids early conflict,
- defers responsibility,
- maintains narrative coherence.

Silence is not free.
It is deferred payment with compounding interest.

---

## Clean reframing

A structurally accurate framing is:

> Love determines whether coupling is desired.  
Structure determines whether coupling is viable.  
Marriage formalizes structure.  
Unspoken infeasibility destroys both.

---

## Closing

Marriage is not sacred.
It is not foolish.
It is not obsolete.

It is a **powerful regime-binding tool**.

Used with articulated feasibility, it stabilizes long-horizon cooperation.
Used without it, it concentrates irreversible failure.

> **Physics does not enforce love.  
It enforces cost, irreversibility, and constraint.  
Marriage merely decides whether those are faced jointly or alone.**
