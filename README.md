# A Core Theory of Action for Bounded Agents

*(Interface, Reachability, and Continuity–Constrained Revision)*

---

## 1. The Problem

Bounded agents must act in environments that are:

* partially observable,
* noisy and non-stationary,
* costly or unsafe to explore,
* temporally delayed,
* and often mediated by other agents or institutions.

Many failures are **irreversible along the agent’s local trajectory**. Errors cannot always be explored, undone, amortized, or delegated. Crucially, agents often cannot even *express* alternative actions or redesigns because the required representational or execution interfaces are unavailable.

Despite accumulated experience, failures recur across biological, artificial, and institutional systems.

**The central question is therefore:**

> How can a bounded agent act and redesign itself over time when action is locally irreversible, execution is delayed, interfaces are limited, and redesign itself must proceed through physically executable intermediate states?

---

## 2. The Irreducible Facts

### 2.1 Local Irreversibility of Action

Any pipeline from

*world → perception → representation → authorization → execution*

is many-to-one and locally non-invertible. Executing an action commits the agent to one realized transition while collapsing alternative futures.

Exact execution does not remove this loss; it stabilizes it.

---

### 2.2 Executable Continuity Constraint

All agents are subject to a **continuity constraint**:

> No agent can reach a future state unless there exists a causally continuous sequence of physically realizable intermediate states connecting the present to that future.

Signals propagate at finite speed. Computation, coordination, learning, communication, and physical movement all require nonzero time and energy. Increasing intention, will, or preference cannot eliminate latency.

Apparent cognitive or institutional “jumps” are threshold effects in observability, not discontinuities in execution.

---

### 2.3 Interface Reachability Constraint

Beyond continuity, agents face a stricter constraint:

> A redesign or action is possible only if it is expressible using interfaces the agent already possesses.

An agent cannot:

* act in a language it cannot parse,
* compute on a non-existent instruction set,
* communicate while rejecting the underlying protocol,
* redesign itself using representations it cannot execute.

Redesign cannot originate ex nihilo. It must be scaffolded through existing interfaces.

---

## 3. Interfaces, Protocols, and Authorization

### 3.1 Interfaces as the Unit of Agency

Agency is exercised not over abstract action sets, but over **interfaces**:

* execution interfaces (muscle, actuators, CPUs),
* representational interfaces (languages, symbols, models),
* coordination interfaces (protocols, laws, procedures).

An interface defines:

* admissible inputs and outputs,
* sequencing and timing constraints,
* error handling (or lack thereof),
* versioned validity conditions.

Rejecting an interface annihilates the action space it defines.

---

### 3.2 Authorization as Interface Conformance

Authorization is not permission in the moral sense. It is **interface-level validity**.

An action is authorized if and only if:

* it conforms to the currently valid interface specification,
* at the correct version,
* within declared scope and time bounds.

Exactness guarantees syntactic validity only. Semantic correctness is never guaranteed globally under bounded precision and abstraction.

---

## 4. Viability as Executability Over Time

### 4.1 Tightened Definition of Viability

Viability is not goal satisfaction or optimality.

> **A system is viable over a horizon H if and only if its critical execution, authorization, feedback, and redesign interfaces remain executable within their physical time, energy, and precision bounds throughout H.**

Loss of any critical interface collapses viability, regardless of intent or preference.

---

### 4.2 Time-Bounded Feedback

Feedback loops are viable only if they close within their physical decay windows:

* before resources dissipate,
* before commitments become irreversible,
* before semantic drift exceeds correction capacity.

Delayed feedback is not weaker feedback; beyond a threshold, it is causally irrelevant.

---

## 5. Waiting, Latency, and Acausality

### 5.1 Waiting as an Action

Waiting is a real action, but of a specific kind:

> Waiting is a temporal commitment that preserves interface eligibility while deferring control, without initiating a new causal chain.

Waiting expends time and opportunity cost but does not influence outcomes unless accompanied by intervention.

---

### 5.2 Institutional Delay as Latency Constraint

Institutional processes are serialized, multi-agent execution pipelines with bounded throughput. Their delays are structural latency constraints, not resistance or intention.

No amount of will can reduce latency below institutional minima.

---

### 5.3 Prohibition of Action-at-a-Distance

> Any model that assumes influence without a continuous, executable chain of interactions is acausal.

Assuming that waiting alone causes outcomes is invalid. Influence requires signal transmission, interpretation, processing, and response.

---

## 6. Interfaces, Precision, and Semantic Drift

Interfaces guarantee local correctness only. Under bounded precision:

* truncation errors accumulate,
* abstractions drift semantically,
* failures appear globally while execution remains locally valid.

Most catastrophic failures are not interface violations, but faithful executions beyond an interface’s semantic radius.

---

## 7. Phase Structure of Interface-Constrained Agents

### Phase 1: Scaffolded Exploration

* Preserve degrees of freedom.
* Act only within safe, executable interfaces.
* Accumulate latent structure.

### Phase 2: Interface Compression

* Identify stable invariants.
* Encode executable, versioned interfaces.
* Collapse distinctions into equivalence classes.

### Phase 3: Scaled Execution

* Execute cheaply and repeatably.
* Accept reduced adaptability.
* Monitor for semantic drift and latency overruns.

### Phase 4: Redesign

Triggered when:

* errors cluster,
* interfaces no longer close feedback loops,
* or redesign latency exceeds viability bounds.

Redesign reintroduces distinctions and revises interfaces using existing scaffolds.

---

## 8. Governance and Coordination

All interfaces encode values by determining:

* which transitions are admissible,
* for how long,
* and under whose authority.

Legitimate governance requires:

* public access to interface specifications,
* explicit versioning and scope,
* symmetric exposure to irreversible risk,
* preserved redesign authority.

Governance failures are interface failures.

---

## 9. Core Synthesis

> **Intelligent action is the phase-appropriate execution and revision of versioned interfaces, under continuity and reachability constraints, chosen so that critical feedback and redesign interfaces remain executable despite irreversible abstraction and bounded resources.**

This framework explains:

* why abstraction is unavoidable,
* why exactness enables scale yet accelerates failure,
* why efficiency creates brittleness,
* why exit and redesign are hard,
* and why authority over interfaces determines long-term survival.

---

## Scope

This theory applies to biological, artificial, institutional, and hybrid agents wherever action requires exact execution under irreversible abstraction, bounded interfaces, and physical time.

It is a boundary logic, not a learning algorithm, optimization method, or moral theory.
