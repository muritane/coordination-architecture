# A Core Theory of Viability Under Bounded Cognition and Action

*(Irreversibility, Interfaces, Continuity, and Loss Allocation)*

---

## 0. Scope

This document specifies a **minimal structural theory** of cognition and action for bounded agents operating under irreversible constraints.

It is not:
- a learning theory,
- an optimization framework,
- a theory of rationality,
- or a normative or political doctrine.

It describes **necessary constraints** on what action, redesign, and persistence can be for agents embedded in physical, temporal, and representational systems.

The theory is **agent-first**. Population- and institutional-scale phenomena are treated only insofar as they are required to preserve viability beyond agent-local limits.

---

## 1. Core Problem

Bounded agents act under the following conditions:

- partial observability,
- finite precision,
- delayed and lossy feedback,
- irreversible commitments,
- limited representational and execution interfaces.

Some failures:
- cannot be explored safely,
- cannot be undone,
- cannot be amortized locally,
- cannot be corrected without abandoning agent-level continuity.

At the same time, correction and persistence are observed at larger scales via:
- replacement,
- redundancy,
- externalized memory,
- statistical selection.

The core problem is therefore:

> Under what structural constraints can bounded agents remain viable when action is locally irreversible, redesign is interface-limited, and some forms of correction require abandoning continuity?

---

## 2. Irreducible Constraints

### 2.1 Local Irreversibility of Action

Any realized action commits the agent to a single trajectory while eliminating alternative futures.

This irreversibility arises from:
- many-to-one perception and representation,
- finite execution precision,
- physical causality.

Irreversibility applies:
- locally along realized trajectories,
- regardless of intelligence or correctness,
- independently of population-level buffering.

Increased precision stabilizes irreversible commitments; it does not remove them.

---

### 2.2 Executable Continuity Constraint

An agent can reach a future state **if and only if** there exists a causally continuous sequence of physically realizable intermediate states connecting present and future.

All processes—computation, communication, coordination, learning, movement—require:
- nonzero time,
- nonzero energy,
- finite bandwidth.

No increase in intent, preference, or reasoning power eliminates latency.

Population-level mechanisms (replacement, selection, reform) preserve function by **breaking agent-level continuity**, not by violating this constraint.

---

### 2.3 Interface Reachability Constraint

An action or redesign is possible **only if** it is expressible and executable using interfaces the agent already possesses.

An agent cannot:
- act in an unparseable language,
- compute on a non-existent instruction set,
- coordinate outside a rejected protocol,
- redesign itself using representations it cannot execute.

Physical realizability in principle does not imply executable reachability under bounded time, precision, and attention.

Interfaces may exist but be unreachable due to:
- latency,
- abstraction depth,
- representational mismatch,
- resource constraints.

---

## 3. Interfaces

### 3.1 Definition

An interface specifies:
- admissible inputs and outputs,
- sequencing and timing constraints,
- error tolerance,
- versioned validity conditions.

Interfaces include:
- execution interfaces,
- representational interfaces,
- coordination interfaces,
- observational interfaces.

Rejecting an interface eliminates the action space it defines.

---

### 3.2 Authorization

Authorization is **interface conformance**, not semantic correctness.

An action is authorized if it conforms to:
- the current interface specification,
- the correct version,
- declared scope and timing.

Authorization guarantees syntactic admissibility only.
Global correctness is not implied and is generally undecidable under bounded conditions.

---

## 4. Cognition

Cognition is not defined in terms of belief, preference, or optimization.

> Cognition is the maintenance, compression, and revision of executable interfaces such that viability-preserving feedback and redesign remain reachable.

Abstraction is unavoidable.
Every abstraction trades:
- flexibility for efficiency,
- adaptability for scale,
- optionality for stability.

---

## 5. Viability

### 5.1 Agent-Local Viability

An agent is viable over horizon **H** if and only if all **critical interfaces** required for:
- execution,
- authorization,
- feedback,
- redesign

remain executable within physical bounds throughout **H**.

Loss of any critical interface collapses agent-local viability, independent of intent or correctness.

---

### 5.2 Criticality and Discoverability

Interface criticality is often:
- context-dependent,
- revealed only ex post,
- identifiable only through irreversible failure.

Agents may compress or discard interfaces that later prove critical.
Such errors are structurally unavoidable under bounded foresight.

---

## 6. Feedback and Time

### 6.1 Time-Bounded Feedback

A feedback loop is viable only if it closes before:
- irreversible commitments dominate outcomes,
- resources dissipate,
- representational drift exceeds correction capacity.

Beyond a threshold delay, feedback is causally irrelevant.

---

### 6.2 Waiting

Waiting is an action that:
- preserves eligibility under existing interfaces,
- defers initiation of new causal chains.

Waiting consumes time and may increase exposure to external drift.
It is not neutral with respect to viability.

---

## 7. Meaning

Meaning is not intrinsic to representations.

> A representation is meaningful if and only if it preserves or expands the set of reachable, viability-preserving actions under uncertainty.

Representations gain meaning by:
- reducing action-relevant uncertainty,
- compressing regularities into executable latents,
- supporting interface-constrained redesign.

When representational drift exceeds redesign reachability, correction occurs through replacement rather than continuity-preserving revision.

---

## 8. Continuity Externalization

### 8.1 Conservation of Continuity

Continuity is conserved across scales, not localized.

Agent-local continuity over extended horizons is possible only through externalized interfaces, including:
- shared representations,
- external memory,
- tools and infrastructure,
- population-level persistence mechanisms.

Conversely, population-level continuity depends on the replaceability of individual agents.

Continuity therefore flows across agents, populations, and artifacts.

---

### 8.2 Loss Allocation

Under irreversible action and bounded redesign, **loss is unavoidable**.

Loss must be absorbed by some combination of:
- agents,
- populations,
- infrastructures,
- or replaceable substrates.

Loss is not eliminated, only routed.

---

### 8.3 Dynamic Loss Routing

When redesign latency exceeds error accumulation, loss is dynamically allocated toward components with:
- higher replaceability,
- faster recovery,
- lower coupling to preserved continuity.

The direction of loss routing depends on:
- available interfaces,
- redesign reachability,
- coupling between failure modes.

---

### 8.4 Interfaces as Loss Routers

Interfaces encode how irreversible loss propagates under failure by determining:
- admissible transitions,
- authority over execution,
- coupling between components.

Thus, interfaces determine where continuity is preserved and where loss concentrates.

---

## 9. Core Synthesis

Bounded cognition and action are constrained by:
- irreversible commitment,
- executable continuity,
- interface reachability,
- finite feedback latency.

Viability depends on preserving executable interfaces across time.
When this is not possible locally, continuity is externalized and loss is allocated elsewhere.

No optimization, equilibrium, or normative criterion is required to derive these constraints.

---

## Scope of Applicability

This theory applies wherever:
- action is irreversible,
- interfaces are exact,
- redesign is bounded,
- and persistence exceeds individual trajectories.

It applies to biological, artificial, institutional, and hybrid systems.
