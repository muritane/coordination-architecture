# Executional Literacies  
## A Structural Taxonomy for Reasoning Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Status, Scope, and Jurisdiction

This document defines a set of **executional literacies**:  
structural competencies required to reason, coordinate, and act coherently in systems where:

- execution is **irreversible**,
- resources are **finite**,
- observability is **partial**,
- environments **drift**,
- and systems halt **before global evaluation or optimization is possible**.

These literacies define a **reasoning admissibility envelope**.

They specify the conditions under which reasoning can safely guide execution,  
not which beliefs are correct, desirable, or justified.

---

### What This Is Not

Executional literacies are **not**:

- moral virtues or ethical claims,
- intelligence measures or cognitive styles,
- personality traits or motivational states,
- cultural markers or status indicators,
- assessments of merit, worth, or legitimacy.

They do not describe *why* agents think as they do,  
nor how they *should* think in general.

They describe **where reasoning fails structurally**  
when embedded in irreversible, resource-bounded execution.

---

### What This Is

Executional literacies are **execution-facing distinctions**.

They concern the ability to:

- preserve necessary constraints,
- maintain category integrity,
- and refuse non-executable assumptions

**while execution is underway** and option space is collapsing.

The perspective is **architectural**, not psychological.  
The unit of analysis is **executional validity**, not internal mental state.

---

## The Executional Regime (Precondition, Not a Literacy)

Before any executional literacy is possible,  
a system must already be situated within an **executional regime**.

This regime is defined by the following invariants:

- Actions execute **regardless of intent or justification**.
- Each action **irreversibly collapses option space**.
- Time, energy, attention, bandwidth, and trust are **bounded**.
- Feedback may be delayed, displaced, partial, or absent.
- Models, abstractions, meanings, and metrics **expire under drift**.
- Systems halt **before** full evaluation or global optimality is achievable.

This regime is **not optional** and **not skill-dependent**.  
It is the environment in which execution occurs.

Reasoning that ignores these invariants may be internally coherent,  
but is **non-isomorphic to executable systems**.

Such reasoning cannot safely guide action.

---

## The Load-Bearing Execution Loop

All bounded executors—human, institutional, or technical—operate through a minimal loop:

**sense → model → act**

This loop is **structural**, not cognitive.

- **Sensing** exists only because action may be required.
- **Modeling** exists only because raw data is not executable.
- **Action** is the reason sensing and modeling exist at all.

Absent pressure to act,  
sensing and modeling collapse into optional interpretation  
and lose any obligation to preserve executional validity.

Models are not upstream beliefs.  
They are **compressions inside the loop** that trade fidelity for executability.

Model failure appears not as epistemic error,  
but as **executional breakdown**.

---

## Foundational Executional Literacy (Singular)

### Definition

**Foundational executional literacy** is the ability to keep the **executional regime load-bearing while reasoning**.

It is the capacity to reason **as if execution were real**,  
even when doing so invalidates preferred narratives, explanations, optimizations, or moral appeals.

This literacy does not optimize outcomes.  
It prevents reasoning that is **invalid under execution**.

All other executional literacies depend on it.

---

### Core Distinctions Preserved

- reachability vs existence  
- irreversibility vs theoretical reversibility  
- traversal vs evaluation  
- bounded redesign vs infinite correction  
- halting vs global optimality  
- simulation vs execution  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Optimizing as if rollback exists**  
  vs  
- **Designing as if every step commits state**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I reasoning as if time, reversibility, or access were infinite?”**

If yes, foundational executional literacy is absent.

When this literacy collapses,  
all higher distinctions degrade into narrative, moralization, or performance.

---

## Derived Executional Literacies  
*(Each protects a specific structural failure surface inside the loop)*

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish **non-negotiable constraints**  
from preferences, tradeoffs, discomfort, or disagreement.

Constraints are not arguments.  
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

They do not soften under protest, consensus, or moral appeal.

---

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs  
- infeasible vs undesirable  
- scarcity vs inconvenience  
- bounded capacity vs lack of motivation  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Reallocating within limits**  
  vs  
- **Arguing with limits**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I treating an invariant as if it could be negotiated, overridden, or appealed away?”**

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about **time-indexed validity**  
under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift.

A claim without an explicit horizon is incomplete.

---

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability  
- transient stability vs persistent invariants  
- expiration vs failure  
- redesign vs justification  
- local optimization vs system horizon collapse  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Maximizing near-term performance**  
  vs  
- **Preserving long-term executability**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I defending something that has expired simply because it once worked?”**

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize **what kind of claim is being made**,  
and to refuse **executionally invalid frames**.

Frames determine what must be supplied  
for a claim to guide action.

Some frames cannot guide action at all,  
even if their internal arguments are correct.

---

### Core Distinctions

- execution claims vs interpretive claims  
- premises vs positions  
- argument vs executability  
- compliance vs premise invalidation  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Winning an argument inside a frame**  
  vs  
- **Rejecting a frame that cannot produce executable action**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I answering a question that cannot guide execution even if answered correctly?”**

---

## Meaning Literacy  
*(Shared Meaning Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Meaning literacy** is the ability to distinguish **internal meaning**  
from **shared meaning-for-coordination**.

Shared meaning exists only when it is:

- externally addressable,
- substitutable across agents,
- discretized by interfaces,
- admitted into a protocol,
- bounded by finite resources,
- capable of failing with attributable cost.

Meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate.

Meaning here is not semantic richness,  
but **coordination sufficiency under cost**.

---

### Core Distinctions

- internal meaning vs executable meaning  
- interpretation vs protocol admission  
- intent vs structural legibility  
- expressiveness vs substitutability  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Expressing understanding**  
  vs  
- **Making understanding executable by others**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I assuming shared understanding where no executable protocol exists?”**

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about **multi-agent execution**  
where independent actions impose costs, risks, or constraints on one another.

Coordination is not chosen.  
It is **imposed by executional conditions**.

---

### Structural Preconditions for Coordination Pressure

Coordination pressure exists only when **all** of the following hold:

- multiple independent agents,
- shared or coupled state,
- partial observability,
- bounded resources,
- irreversible action,
- non-trivial failure cost,
- irreversible externalities.

---

### Core Distinctions

- shared goals vs shared incentives  
- local rationality vs global failure  
- alignment vs coupling  
- authority vs responsibility  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Optimizing locally correct actions**  
  vs  
- **Preventing globally irreversible failure**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I attributing a structural coordination failure to individual intent or character?”**

---

## Metrics Literacy  
*(Evaluation Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Metrics literacy** is the ability to distinguish **internal judgment**  
from **shared metrics-for-evaluation**.

A metric becomes real-for-coordination only when it is:

- substitutable across evaluators,
- executable under a protocol,
- minimally sufficient for its comparison,
- bounded by finite evaluation resources,
- capable of failing with visible cost.

---

### Core Distinctions

- judgment vs metric  
- sufficiency vs simplicity  
- comparability vs false equivalence  
- legibility vs manipulability  
- latent flexibility vs inefficiency  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Measuring what is easy to count**  
  vs  
- **Measuring what is necessary to preserve execution**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Is this metric collapsing important distinctions or externalizing costs I am not pricing?”**

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason under uncertainty where:

- outcomes vary,
- feedback is delayed,
- and some losses dominate the evaluation horizon.

Some losses invalidate the evaluation frame itself.

---

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin  
- mean outcomes vs tail risk  
- recoverable loss vs terminal loss  
- uncertainty vs ignorance  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Optimizing average outcomes**  
  vs  
- **Avoiding unrecoverable states**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I optimizing averages in a system where some failures are unrecoverable?”**

---

## Authority, Legitimacy, and Respect Literacy

### Definition

**Authority literacy** is the ability to distinguish **permission**, **acceptance**,  
and **coordination discount** as separate structural constraints.

They are not interchangeable.

---

### Structural Roles

- **Authority** — explicit permission to act or change state.  
- **Legitimacy** — expectation of acceptance without defensive coordination.  
- **Respect** — temporary suspension of verification.

Respect decays unless renewed by executional reliability.

---

### Core Distinctions

- permission vs acceptability  
- enforcement vs coordination cost  
- deference vs trust  
- authority vs redesign authority  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Acting because it is allowed**  
  vs  
- **Acting without triggering defensive coordination**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I substituting permission or status for exposure to executional consequences?”**

---

## Model Literacy (Meta-Literacy)

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about the **scope, limits, and failure modes of representations**  
used inside executable systems.

All execution requires compression.  
All compression fails under drift.

Model failure is often laundered  
by translating narrative comfort into apparent coherence.

---

### Core Distinctions

- model vs world  
- internal coherence vs external validity  
- signal vs artifact  
- critique vs hostility  
- interpretability vs executability  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Defending a model’s elegance**  
  vs  
- **Retiring a model before it causes irreversible error**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> **“Am I defending a model past the point where it can safely guide action?”**

---

## Dependency Structure

Executional literacies are **not independent**.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers,  
which then become narrative-driven, moralized, or performative.

A typical collapse sequence under pressure:

1. Foundational executional literacy  
2. Constraint literacy  
3. Horizon literacy  
4. Frame literacy  
5. Meaning literacy  
6. Coordination literacy  
7. Metrics literacy  
8. Risk literacy  
9. Authority literacy  
10. Model literacy (recursive, cross-cutting)

Model literacy is meta-level and recursive:  
failure can corrupt lower layers early by laundering non-executable assumptions.

This ordering reflects **common failure patterns**,  
not logical necessity.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:

- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- resistance to narrative substitution,
- willingness to incur **real cost deliberately**,
- refusal to rely on **non-executable infinities**.

Literacy includes knowing:

- when not to act,
- when to refuse ill-posed execution,
- and when redesign is required rather than justification.

---

## Closing

Executional literacies do not make systems fair, optimal, or humane.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

As environments grow more coupled, constrained, and unstable,  
these literacies become less optional.

Systems that lack them rarely fail immediately.  
They fail **late**, **expensively**,  
with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
