# Executional Literacies  
## A Structural Taxonomy for Reasoning Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Status and Intent

This document defines a set of **executional literacies** required for coherent
reasoning, coordination, and action in systems that:

- execute under **bounded resources**,
- produce **irreversible consequences**,
- operate with **partial observability**,
- evolve under **environment drift**,
- and must preserve **viability over time**, not merely achieve local success.

These literacies are **not**:

- moral virtues,
- intelligence measures,
- personality traits,
- rhetorical or social skills,
- indicators of merit or worth.

They are **structural competencies**:  
the ability to maintain specific distinctions **while action is executing** and
constraints are asserting themselves.

The perspective is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological,
pedagogical, or normative.

---

## Core Premise: Execution Is Real

All claims in this document assume the following invariants:

- **Actions execute**, regardless of intent or interpretation.
- Execution consumes finite capacity and collapses option space.
- Consequences propagate according to **system topology**, not narrative.
- Feedback may be delayed, distributed, buffered, or partially invisible.
- Models, metrics, and abstractions **expire under drift**.

Reasoning that ignores these conditions may be internally coherent,  
but it is **not reasoning about executable systems**.

---

## What an Executional Literacy Is

A literacy is present when a distinction is:

- available **without prompting**,
- stable under inconvenience, uncertainty, or social pressure,
- **action-guiding** rather than merely interpretable,
- violated only with **explicitly acknowledged cost**.

A literacy is absent when a distinction:

- collapses under time pressure or coordination stress,
- is acknowledged abstractly but ignored at execution time,
- is replaced by narrative, intent, or moral explanation.

Executional competence is not recognized by declared belief.  
It is recognized by **which structural errors no longer occur**.

---

## Foundational Executional Literacy

### Definition

**Executional literacy** is the ability to reason correctly about action
in systems where:

- execution is **irreversible**,
- resources are **finite**,
- state spaces are **effectively infinite relative to traversal capacity**,
- and halting occurs before global evaluation is possible.

In such systems, **reachability replaces existence** as the relevant category.

---

### Core Distinctions

- existence vs **reachability before halting**
- evaluation vs **traversal under constraint**
- optimization vs **discovery**
- local success vs **horizon-constrained viability**
- reversibility in theory vs **irreversibility in execution**

---

### Failure Modes

- treating open-world systems as closed-world optimization problems
- demanding global optimality where traversal dominates
- interpreting non-discovery as non-existence or failure
- assuming equal access implies equal reachability
- assigning responsibility based on outcomes alone

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish
**non-negotiable constraints** from preferences, tradeoffs, or discomfort.

Constraints are not arguments.
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

---

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs
- infeasible vs undesirable
- scarcity vs inconvenience
- bounded capacity vs lack of motivation

---

### Failure Modes

- attempting to negotiate with constraints
- moralizing infeasibility
- treating limits as attitude problems
- escalating pressure where redesign is required

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about
time-indexed validity under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift.

A claim that lacks a horizon is incomplete.

---

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability
- transient stability vs persistent invariants
- expiration vs failure
- redesign vs justification

---

### Failure Modes

- horizon collapse (“works now → works indefinitely”)
- defending expired solutions due to identity or precedent
- punishing redesign as inconsistency
- optimizing short-term metrics while degrading long-term survivability

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize
what kind of claim is being made,
and to refuse executionally invalid frames.

Frames determine **what must be supplied** for a claim to guide action.

---

### Core Distinctions

- execution claims vs interpretive claims
- premises vs positions
- argument vs executability
- compliance vs premise invalidation

---

### Failure Modes

- arguing inside ill-typed frames
- supplying correct information to false premises
- mistaking refusal to execute as bad faith
- allowing narrative substitution for structural accounting

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about
multi-agent systems where independent actions
impose costs, risks, or constraints on one another.

Coordination is not chosen.
It is **imposed by executional conditions**.

---

### Structural Preconditions for Coordination

Coordination pressure emerges only when **all** of the following hold:

- multiple independent agents,
- shared or coupled state,
- partial observability,
- bounded resources,
- irreversible action,
- non-trivial failure cost.

Remove any one, and coordination pressure relaxes.

---

### Core Distinctions

- shared goals vs shared incentives
- local rationality vs global failure
- alignment vs coupling
- authority vs responsibility

---

### Failure Modes

- attributing coordination failure to intent or character
- assuming cooperation without mechanisms
- moralizing misalignment
- optimizing individuals at the expense of system viability

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason about uncertainty
where outcomes are variable, feedback is delayed,
and some losses dominate the evaluation horizon.

---

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin
- mean outcomes vs tail risk
- recoverable loss vs terminal loss
- uncertainty vs ignorance

---

### Failure Modes

- optimizing averages while ignoring extinction
- dismissing tail events as noise
- relying on probabilistic correction without accounting for accumulation
- mistaking lack of feedback for lack of risk

---

## Governance Literacy

### Definition

**Governance literacy** is the ability to reason about
rules, enforcement, authority, and redesign
under incomplete foresight and drifting conditions.

Governance is a response to execution,
not a substitute for it.

---

### Core Distinctions

- rules vs implementations
- compliance vs legitimacy
- enforcement vs consent
- reform vs patching
- closure sufficiency vs symbolic consistency

---

### Failure Modes

- moralizing governance breakdowns
- treating rule violations as character flaws
- defending structures past their validity horizon
- resisting redesign to preserve narrative coherence

---

## Model Literacy (Meta-Literacy)

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about
the limits, scope, and failure modes of representations.

All executable systems rely on compression.
All compression eventually fails under drift.

---

### Core Distinctions

- model vs world
- internal coherence vs external validity
- signal vs artifact
- critique vs hostility

---

### Failure Modes

- defending models past their validity envelope
- mistaking abstraction failure for personal attack
- confusing interpretability with executability
- assuming correctness persists without revalidation

---

## Dependency Structure

These literacies are not independent.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers,
which then become moralized, performative, or narrative-driven.

A typical dependency ordering:

1. Executional literacy  
2. Constraint literacy  
3. Horizon literacy  
4. Frame literacy  
5. Coordination literacy  
6. Risk literacy  
7. Governance literacy  
8. Model literacy  

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:

- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- resistance to narrative substitution,
- and the ability to **incur cost deliberately**.

Correctness does not guarantee safety.  
Literacy includes knowing **when not to act**.

---

## Closing

These literacies do not make systems fair, optimal, or humane.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

As environments grow more coupled, constrained, and unstable,
these literacies become less optional.

Systems that lack them rarely fail immediately.
They fail **late**, **expensively**, and
with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes persists.
