# Executional Literacies  
## A Structural Taxonomy for Reasoning, Meaning, Evaluation, and Authority Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Status and Intent

This document defines a set of **executional literacies** required for coherent reasoning, coordination, and action in systems that:

- execute under **bounded resources** (time, energy, attention, bandwidth),
- produce **irreversible consequences**,
- operate under **partial observability**,
- evolve under **environmental and institutional drift**,
- and must preserve **viability over time**, not merely achieve local success.

These literacies are **not**:

- moral virtues or ethical claims,
- intelligence measures or talent indicators,
- personality traits or motivational states,
- social skills, rhetorical ability, or status signals,
- judgments of worth, merit, or legitimacy.

They are **structural competencies**:
the ability to maintain specific distinctions **while execution is underway**, constraints are binding, and option space is collapsing.

The perspective throughout is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological, pedagogical, or normative.

---

## Core Premise: Execution Is Real

All claims in this document assume the following invariants:

- **Actions execute** regardless of intent, belief, justification, or sincerity.
- Execution consumes finite capacity and **irreversibly collapses option space**.
- Consequences propagate according to **system topology**, not narrative framing.
- Feedback may be delayed, distributed, buffered, displaced, or invisible.
- All abstractions, models, meanings, and metrics **expire under drift**.

Reasoning that ignores these conditions may be internally coherent,
but it is **not reasoning about executable systems**.

---

## The Load-Bearing Execution Loop

All bounded executors—human, institutional, or technical—operate through a minimal loop:

**sense → model → act**

This loop is **structural**, not cognitive.

- **Sensing** is bounded by observability, latency, noise, and topology.
- **Modeling** is unavoidable compression that discards distinctions to remain executable.
- **Action** is irreversible execution whose effects propagate beyond interpretation.

Models are **not upstream beliefs**.
They are **closures inside the loop** that trade fidelity for executability.

Model failure appears not as epistemic error, but as **executional breakdown**.

Executional literacy is the ability to reason correctly about
**where the loop is load-bearing** and **which compressions are no longer safe**.

---

## What an Executional Literacy Is

A literacy is present when a distinction is:

- available **without prompting**,
- stable under time pressure, uncertainty, or coordination stress,
- **action-guiding** rather than merely interpretable,
- violated only with **explicitly acknowledged cost**.

A literacy is absent when a distinction:

- collapses under execution pressure,
- is acknowledged abstractly but ignored at runtime,
- is replaced by narrative, intent, or moral explanation,
- or relies on **non-executable infinities**
  (of time, information, reversibility, interpretation, or redesign).

Executional competence is not recognized by declared belief.
It is recognized by **which structural errors no longer occur**.

---

## Foundational Executional Literacy

### Definition

**Executional literacy** is the ability to reason correctly about action
in systems where:

- execution is **irreversible**,
- resources are **finite**,
- environments **drift**,
- state spaces are effectively infinite relative to traversal capacity,
- and halting occurs before global evaluation is possible.

In such systems, **reachability replaces existence** as the relevant category.

---

### Core Distinctions

- existence vs **reachability before halting**
- evaluation vs **traversal under constraint**
- optimization vs **discovery**
- local success vs **horizon-constrained viability**
- theoretical reversibility vs **executional irreversibility**

---

### Failure Modes

- treating open-world systems as closed optimization problems
- demanding global optimality where traversal dominates
- interpreting non-discovery as non-existence or failure
- assuming equal access implies equal reachability
- assigning responsibility based on outcomes alone

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish
**non-negotiable constraints** from preferences, tradeoffs, discomfort, or disagreement.

Constraints are not arguments.
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

---

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs
- infeasible vs undesirable
- scarcity vs inconvenience
- bounded capacity vs lack of motivation

---

### Failure Modes

- attempting to negotiate with constraints
- moralizing infeasibility
- treating limits as attitude problems
- escalating pressure where redesign is required

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about
time-indexed validity under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift.

A claim without a horizon is incomplete.

---

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability
- transient stability vs persistent invariants
- expiration vs failure
- redesign vs justification

---

### Failure Modes

- horizon collapse (“works now → works indefinitely”)
- defending expired solutions due to identity or precedent
- punishing redesign as inconsistency
- optimizing short-term metrics while degrading survivability

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize
what kind of claim is being made,
and to refuse **executionally invalid frames**.

Frames determine what must be supplied
for a claim to guide action.

---

### Core Distinctions

- execution claims vs interpretive claims
- premises vs positions
- argument vs executability
- compliance vs premise invalidation

---

### Failure Modes

- arguing inside ill-typed frames
- supplying correct information to false premises
- mistaking refusal to execute as bad faith
- allowing narrative substitution for structural accounting

---

## Meaning Literacy (Shared Meaning Under Constraint)

### Definition

**Meaning literacy** is the ability to distinguish
**internal meaning** from **shared meaning-for-coordination**.

Internal meaning may be rich, continuous, and unconstrained.
Shared meaning-for-coordination exists only when meaning is:

- externally addressable,
- substitutable across agents,
- discretized by interfaces,
- admitted into a protocol,
- bounded by finite resources,
- capable of failing with attributable cost.

Meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate.

---

### Core Distinctions

- internal meaning vs executable meaning
- interpretation vs protocol admission
- intent vs structural legibility
- expressiveness vs substitutability

---

### Failure Modes

- assuming shared understanding without executability
- relying on reinterpretation to preserve coordination
- appealing to intent where protocol has cut meaning
- treating sincerity as a substitute for structure

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about
multi-agent systems where independent actions
impose costs, risks, or constraints on one another.

Coordination is not chosen.
It is **imposed by executional conditions**.

---

### Structural Preconditions for Coordination Pressure

Coordination pressure emerges only when **all** of the following hold:

- multiple independent agents,
- shared or coupled state,
- partial observability,
- bounded resources,
- irreversible action,
- non-trivial failure cost.

Remove any one, and coordination pressure relaxes.

---

### Core Distinctions

- shared goals vs shared incentives
- local rationality vs global failure
- alignment vs coupling
- authority vs responsibility

---

### Failure Modes

- attributing coordination failure to intent or character
- assuming cooperation without mechanisms
- moralizing misalignment
- optimizing individuals at the expense of system viability

---

## Metrics Literacy (Evaluation Under Constraint)

### Definition

**Metrics literacy** is the ability to distinguish
**internal judgment** from **shared metrics-for-evaluation**.

A metric becomes real-for-coordination only when it is:

- substitutable across evaluators,
- executable under a protocol,
- minimally sufficient for the comparison it claims to make,
- bounded by finite evaluation resources,
- capable of failing with visible cost.

Metrics that survive only through reinterpretation
have failed as shared evaluative artifacts.

---

### Core Distinctions

- judgment vs metric
- sufficiency vs simplicity
- comparability vs false equivalence
- latent flexibility vs inefficiency

---

### Failure Modes

- collapsing heterogeneous systems into a single axis
- ignoring coordination or control cost
- treating preserved degrees of freedom as waste
- assuming universal metrics across constraint regimes
- externalizing cost to unmeasured domains

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason about uncertainty
where outcomes vary, feedback is delayed,
and some losses dominate the evaluation horizon.

---

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin
- mean outcomes vs tail risk
- recoverable loss vs terminal loss
- uncertainty vs ignorance

---

### Failure Modes

- optimizing averages while ignoring extinction
- dismissing tail events as noise
- relying on probabilistic correction under accumulation
- mistaking lack of feedback for lack of risk

---

## Authority, Legitimacy, and Respect Literacy

### Definition

**Authority literacy** is the ability to distinguish
permission, acceptance, and coordination discount
as separate structural constraints.

They are not interchangeable.

---

### Structural Roles

- **Authority** — explicit permission to act or change state.
- **Legitimacy** — expectation of acceptance without defensive coordination.
- **Respect** — temporary suspension of verification.

---

### Core Distinctions

- permission vs acceptability
- enforcement vs coordination cost
- deference vs trust
- authority vs redesign authority

---

### Failure Modes

- assuming authority guarantees acceptance
- mistaking silence for consent
- confusing deference with respect
- overusing authority to bypass coordination
- moralizing resistance instead of pricing risk

---

## Authority Insertion (Structural Pathology)

Authority insertion occurs when an actor asserts
evaluative or directive control over another executor’s path
**without invariant specification, horizon declaration,
executional exposure, or redesign boundary**.

It operates via reinterpretation rather than execution
and collapses under metric binding.

Authority insertion is not leadership.
It is **control without exposure**.

---

## Model Literacy (Meta-Literacy)

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about
the limits, scope, and failure modes of representations
used inside executable systems.

All execution requires compression.
All compression eventually fails under drift.

---

### Core Distinctions

- model vs world
- internal coherence vs external validity
- signal vs artifact
- critique vs hostility
- interpretability vs executability

---

### Failure Modes

- defending models past their executable envelope
- mistaking abstraction failure for personal attack
- confusing explanatory power with action-guidance
- assuming correctness persists without revalidation

---

## Dependency Structure

These literacies are not independent.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers,
which then become moralized, performative,
or narrative-driven.

A typical dependency ordering:

1. Executional literacy  
2. Constraint literacy  
3. Horizon literacy  
4. Frame literacy  
5. Meaning literacy  
6. Coordination literacy  
7. Metrics literacy  
8. Risk literacy  
9. Authority literacy  
10. Model literacy (recursive, cross-cutting)

Model literacy is meta-level and recursive:
failure can corrupt lower layers early
by laundering non-executable assumptions.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:

- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- resistance to narrative substitution,
- willingness to incur **real cost deliberately**,
- refusal to rely on **non-executable infinities**.

Literacy includes knowing **when not to act**,
when to refuse ill-posed execution,
and when redesign is required rather than justification.

Correctness does not guarantee safety.
Survival requires structural coherence under load.

---

## Closing

These literacies do not make systems fair, optimal, or humane.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

As environments grow more coupled, constrained, and unstable,
these literacies become less optional.

Systems that lack them rarely fail immediately.
They fail **late**, **expensively**, and
with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
