# Executional Literacies  
## A Structural Taxonomy for Reasoning Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Status and Intent

This document defines a set of **executional literacies**:  
structural competencies required to reason, coordinate, and act coherently in systems where:

- execution is **irreversible**,
- resources are **finite**,
- observability is **partial**,
- environments **drift**,
- and halting occurs **before global evaluation is possible**.

These literacies are **not**:
- moral virtues,
- intelligence measures,
- personality traits,
- motivational states,
- or indicators of merit or legitimacy.

They are **execution-facing distinctions**:  
the ability to preserve specific constraints and categories **while execution is underway** and option space is collapsing.

The perspective is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological, pedagogical, or normative.

---

## The Executional Regime (Not a Literacy)

Before any literacy is possible, a system must be correctly situated in the **executional regime** it inhabits.

This regime is defined by the following invariants:

- Actions **execute regardless of intent or justification**.
- Execution **irreversibly collapses option space**.
- Resources (time, energy, attention, bandwidth) are **bounded**.
- Feedback may be delayed, displaced, partial, or invisible.
- Models, abstractions, meanings, and metrics **expire under drift**.
- Systems halt **before** full evaluation or global optimization is possible.

This regime is **not a skill** and **not optional**.  
It is the world in which execution occurs.

Reasoning that ignores these conditions may be internally coherent,  
but it is **not reasoning about executable systems**.

---

## The Load-Bearing Execution Loop

All bounded executors—human, institutional, or technical—operate through a minimal loop:

**sense → model → act**

This loop is **structural**, not cognitive.

- **Sensing** exists only because action may be required.
- **Modeling** exists only because raw data is not executable.
- **Action** is the reason sensing and modeling exist at all.

Remove the pressure to act, and sensing and modeling collapse into optional interpretation.

Models are not upstream beliefs.  
They are **compressions inside the loop** that trade fidelity for executability.

Model failure appears not as epistemic error,  
but as **executional breakdown**.

---

## Foundational Executional Literacy (Singular)

### Definition

**Foundational executional literacy** is the ability to keep the **executional regime load-bearing while reasoning**.

It is the capacity to reason **as if execution were real**, even when that invalidates preferred narratives, explanations, or optimizations.

This literacy does **not** optimize outcomes.  
It prevents reasoning that is **invalid under execution**.

---

### Core Distinctions Maintained

- reachability vs existence
- irreversibility vs theoretical reversibility
- traversal vs evaluation
- bounded redesign vs infinite correction
- halting vs global optimality

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I reasoning as if time, reversibility, or access were infinite?”**

If the answer is yes, foundational executional literacy is absent.

All other literacies depend on this one.  
If it collapses, higher distinctions become moralized, narrative-driven, or performative.

---

## Derived Executional Literacies  
*(Each protects a specific failure surface inside the loop)*

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish **non-negotiable constraints** from preferences, tradeoffs, discomfort, or disagreement.

Constraints are not arguments.  
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

---

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs
- infeasible vs undesirable
- scarcity vs inconvenience
- bounded capacity vs lack of motivation

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I treating an invariant as if it could be negotiated, overridden, or morally appealed to?”**

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about **time-indexed validity** under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift.

A claim without a horizon is incomplete.

---

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability
- transient stability vs persistent invariants
- expiration vs failure
- redesign vs justification

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I defending something that has expired simply because it once worked?”**

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize **what kind of claim is being made**, and to refuse **executionally invalid frames**.

Frames determine what must be supplied for a claim to guide action.

---

### Core Distinctions

- execution claims vs interpretive claims
- premises vs positions
- argument vs executability
- compliance vs premise invalidation

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I answering a question that cannot produce executable action even if answered correctly?”**

---

## Meaning Literacy  
*(Shared Meaning Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Meaning literacy** is the ability to distinguish **internal meaning** from **shared meaning-for-coordination**.

Shared meaning exists only when it is:

- externally addressable,
- substitutable across agents,
- discretized by interfaces,
- admitted into a protocol,
- bounded by finite resources,
- capable of failing with attributable cost.

Meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate.

---

### Core Distinctions

- internal meaning vs executable meaning
- interpretation vs protocol admission
- intent vs structural legibility
- expressiveness vs substitutability

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I assuming shared understanding where no executable protocol exists?”**

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about **multi-agent execution** where independent actions impose costs, risks, or constraints on one another.

Coordination is not chosen.  
It is **imposed by executional conditions**.

---

### Structural Preconditions for Coordination Pressure

Coordination pressure exists only when **all** of the following hold:

- multiple independent agents,
- shared or coupled state,
- partial observability,
- bounded resources,
- irreversible action,
- non-trivial failure cost.

---

### Core Distinctions

- shared goals vs shared incentives
- local rationality vs global failure
- alignment vs coupling
- authority vs responsibility

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I attributing a structural coordination failure to individual intent or character?”**

---

## Metrics Literacy  
*(Evaluation Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Metrics literacy** is the ability to distinguish **internal judgment** from **shared metrics-for-evaluation**.

A metric becomes real-for-coordination only when it is:

- substitutable across evaluators,
- executable under a protocol,
- minimally sufficient for its comparison,
- bounded by finite evaluation resources,
- capable of failing with visible cost.

---

### Core Distinctions

- judgment vs metric
- sufficiency vs simplicity
- comparability vs false equivalence
- latent flexibility vs inefficiency

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Is this metric collapsing important distinctions or externalizing costs I am not pricing?”**

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason about uncertainty where:

- outcomes vary,
- feedback is delayed,
- and some losses dominate the evaluation horizon.

---

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin
- mean outcomes vs tail risk
- recoverable loss vs terminal loss
- uncertainty vs ignorance

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I optimizing averages in a system where some failures are unrecoverable?”**

---

## Authority, Legitimacy, and Respect Literacy

### Definition

**Authority literacy** is the ability to distinguish **permission**, **acceptance**, and **coordination discount** as separate structural constraints.

They are not interchangeable.

---

### Structural Roles

- **Authority** — explicit permission to act or change state.
- **Legitimacy** — expectation of acceptance without defensive coordination.
- **Respect** — temporary suspension of verification.

---

### Core Distinctions

- permission vs acceptability
- enforcement vs coordination cost
- deference vs trust
- authority vs redesign authority

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I substituting permission or status for exposure to executional consequences?”**

---

## Model Literacy (Meta-Literacy)

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about the **scope, limits, and failure modes of representations** used inside executable systems.

All execution requires compression.  
All compression eventually fails under drift.

---

### Core Distinctions

- model vs world
- internal coherence vs external validity
- signal vs artifact
- critique vs hostility
- interpretability vs executability

---

### Characteristic Failure Question

> **“Am I defending a model past the point where it can safely guide action?”**

---

## Dependency Structure

These literacies are **not independent**.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers, which then become narrative-driven, moralized, or performative.

A typical dependency ordering:

1. Foundational executional literacy  
2. Constraint literacy  
3. Horizon literacy  
4. Frame literacy  
5. Meaning literacy  
6. Coordination literacy  
7. Metrics literacy  
8. Risk literacy  
9. Authority literacy  
10. Model literacy (recursive, cross-cutting)

Model literacy is meta-level and recursive:  
failure can corrupt lower layers early by laundering non-executable assumptions.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:

- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- resistance to narrative substitution,
- willingness to incur **real cost deliberately**,
- refusal to rely on **non-executable infinities**.

Literacy includes knowing:
- when not to act,
- when to refuse ill-posed execution,
- and when redesign is required rather than justification.

---

## Closing

Executional literacies do not make systems fair, optimal, or humane.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

As environments grow more coupled, constrained, and unstable,
these literacies become less optional.

Systems that lack them rarely fail immediately.  
They fail **late**, **expensively**,  
with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
