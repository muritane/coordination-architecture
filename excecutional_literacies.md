# Executional Literacies
## Structural Alphabets for Reasoning Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Purpose

This document specifies **executional literacies**: the minimal **distinctions** a reasoner must preserve when reasoning must **compile into irreversible action under constraint**.

It is not a theory of intelligence, virtue, ideology, or motivation.  
It is a description of **structural failure modes** that occur when internally coherent reasoning is **non-isomorphic** to the executional environment it is meant to guide.

---

## Scope and Jurisdiction

Executional literacies apply only inside an **executional regime**—environments where:

- actions commit state irreversibly (or rollback is bounded/costly),
- time, attention, capital, trust, bandwidth, and capacity are finite,
- feedback is delayed, partial, displaced, or absent,
- models and metrics drift,
- systems halt before global evaluation or optimization is possible.

If these invariants do not bind, the “alphabet” below may not be acquired or rewarded.  
Failure to parse or use a literacy often indicates **jurisdiction mismatch** (wrong regime), not stupidity or bad faith.

---

## Definitions

To stabilize terms:

- **Alphabet**: a minimal set of **distinctions** required for execution-safe reasoning in a regime.
- **Literacy**: the ability to **reliably preserve and apply** that alphabet **under execution pressure** (while options collapse and costs accrue).
- **Executional validity**: whether reasoning remains **load-bearing** when compiled into action, not whether it is persuasive, moral, or elegant.

---

## What This Is Not

Executional literacies are not:

- traits, virtues, or general “reasoning ability,”
- moral/political positions,
- psychological explanations of why agents think as they do,
- status markers or prescriptions for how everyone “should” think in all contexts.

They do not rank people.  
They identify which distinctions are required for safe execution in specific environments.

## Quick Map
### Literacies and the Failure Surfaces They Guard

- **Foundational Executional Literacy**: guards against **rollback illusions** and **non-executable reasoning** guiding action.
- **Constraint Literacy**: guards against **negotiating invariants** and mistaking scarcity for preference.
- **Horizon Literacy**: guards against **time-index errors** (drift, accumulation, expiration).
- **Frame Literacy**: guards against **action-mapping failure** (correct inside frame, useless in execution).
- **Meaning Literacy**: guards against **coordination-reference failure** (meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate in execution-coupled settings).
- **Coordination Literacy**: guards against **multi-agent externality blindness** and intent-attribution where structure governs.
- **Metrics Literacy**: guards against **proxy collapse**, gaming, and cost externalization via measurement.
- **Risk & Uncertainty Literacy**: guards against **ruin blindness** (tail risks that invalidate the evaluation frame).
- **Access Control Literacy**: guards against confusing **permission/legitimacy/status** with runtime gating and consequences.
- **Representation Literacy**: guards against **compression misuse** and **scope drift** in representations.

## The Executional Loop

All bounded executors (human, institutional, technical) enact a minimal loop:

**sense → model → act**

This is structural, not psychological:

- Sensing exists because action may be required.
- Modeling exists because raw data is not executable.
- Action is the reason sensing and modeling exist at all.

When execution pressure is absent:

- sensing degrades into observation,
- modeling degrades into interpretation,
- reasoning loses obligation to preserve executability.

Models are compressions inside the loop—not upstream truth claims.  
Model failure appears as **executional breakdown**, not merely epistemic error.

## Foundational Executional Literacy (Singular)

### Definition

**Foundational executional literacy** is the capacity to keep the **executional regime** load-bearing while reasoning.

It is the ability to reason **as if runtime is real**—even when doing so invalidates preferred narratives, identity commitments, moral framings, optimization goals, or persuasive strategies.

This literacy does not optimize outcomes.  
It prevents **non-executable reasoning** from governing action.

All other executional literacies depend on it.

### Core Alphabet (Distinctions Preserved)

- **reachability** vs **existence**
- **irreversibility** vs **theoretical reversibility**
- **traversal** vs **evaluation**
- **bounded redesign** vs **infinite correction**
- **halting** vs **global optimality**
- **simulation** vs **execution**

### Failure Signature

Reasoning patterns that implicitly require invisible rollback, such as:

- plans that assume unlimited retries,
- strategies that defer payment indefinitely,
- “we can always undo it later” in systems where undo is partial/costly,
- designs that only work if the environment stays static.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I reasoning as if time, reversibility, access, or retries were effectively infinite?*

---

## Derived Executional Literacies
Each literacy below guards a specific structural failure surface.

---

## 1) Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish **non-negotiable constraints** from preferences, tradeoffs, or discomfort.

Constraints are not arguments.  
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

### Core Alphabet

- **hard constraints** vs **soft tradeoffs**
- **infeasible** vs **undesirable**
- **scarcity** vs **inconvenience**
- **bounded capacity** vs **lack of motivation**

### Failure Signature

- Attempting persuasion where feasibility is the blocker.
- Treating physical/capital/attention limits as attitudes.
- Plans that “work” only if an invariant yields.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I treating an invariant as if it could be negotiated away?*

---

## 2) Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about **time-indexed validity** under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift.

A claim without a horizon is incomplete.

### Core Alphabet

- **short-horizon sufficiency** vs **long-horizon viability**
- **transient stability** vs **persistent invariants**
- **expiration** vs **failure**
- **redesign** vs **justification**

### Failure Signature

- Defending something because it once worked, despite drift.
- “Temporary” measures that become permanent by default.
- Ignoring accumulation (technical debt, trust depletion, compounding risk).

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I defending something that has expired because it once worked?*

---

## 3) Frame Literacy

### Definition

A **frame** is a mapping from claims to executable actions.

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize what kind of claim is being made and whether that frame can produce action that survives execution.

Some frames are internally coherent yet structurally incapable of guiding action.

### Core Alphabet

- **execution claims** vs **interpretive claims**
- **premises** vs **positions**
- **argument success** vs **execution success**
- **explanation** vs **control**

### Failure Signature

- Winning debates that produce no implementable moves.
- Correct answers inside a frame that cannot generate an executable policy, design, or protocol.
- Treating interpretive coherence as operational guidance.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Would a correct answer inside this frame still fail to guide action?*

---

## 4) Meaning Literacy
### Shared Meaning Under Constraint

### Definition

**Meaning literacy** is the ability to distinguish **internal meaning** from **shared meaning-for-coordination**.

In execution-coupled environments, shared meaning exists only when it is:

- externally addressable,
- substitutable across agents,
- discretized by interfaces,
- admitted into a protocol,
- capable of failing with attributable cost.

Meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate **where execution externalities are real**.

### Failure Signature

- Assuming “we’re aligned” without an executable protocol.
- Relying on nuance or vibe where interfaces require discreteness.
- Treating private interpretations as if they were shared commitments.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I assuming shared understanding where no executable protocol exists?*

---

## 5) Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about multi-agent execution under shared state and irreversible externalities.

Coordination is imposed by execution, not chosen.

### Core Alphabet

- **local rationality** vs **global failure**
- **alignment** vs **coupling**
- **authority** vs **responsibility**
- **intent** vs **structure**

### Failure Signature

- Blaming motives when incentives/constraints explain outcomes.
- Designing locally optimal behaviors that collapse shared systems.
- Ignoring externalities because they’re off-ledger or delayed.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I blaming intent where structure is load-bearing?*

---

## 6) Metrics Literacy
### Evaluation Under Constraint

### Definition

**Metrics literacy** is the ability to distinguish internal judgment from metrics that are **real-for-coordination**—i.e., they allocate attention, incentives, resources, and blame.

Metrics consume resources and can externalize cost when misaligned.

### Core Alphabet

- **measurement** vs **instrumentation cost**
- **proxy** vs **target**
- **signal** vs **gaming**
- **local improvements** vs **system health**

### Failure Signature

- A metric improves while the system degrades.
- Agents optimize to the measure, not the mission.
- Measurement collapses distinctions and pushes cost outside the metric boundary.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Is this metric collapsing distinctions or externalizing cost?*

---

## 7) Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk & uncertainty literacy** is the ability to reason under uncertainty where some losses invalidate the evaluation frame itself.

Not all downside is commensurate.  
Some downside is terminal.

### Core Alphabet

- **expected value** vs **ruin**
- **mean outcomes** vs **tail risk**
- **recoverable loss** vs **terminal loss**
- **variance** vs **fragility**

### Failure Signature

- Optimizing averages in environments where tails kill the system.
- Treating rare catastrophic modes as “acceptable” because they’re low probability.
- Confusing uncertainty with harmlessness.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I optimizing averages in a system where tails can end the system?*

---

## 8) Access Control Literacy
### Permission, Legitimacy, and Coordination Discount

### Definition

**Access control literacy** distinguishes:

- **permission** (what you are allowed to do),
- **legitimacy** (what others will accept without enforcement),
- **coordination discount** (the trust/latency tax applied to your actions).

These are access-control mechanisms in shared-state systems, not virtues.

### Failure Signature

- Substituting status for gating mechanisms.
- Confusing “allowed” with “safe,” or “legitimate” with “effective.”
- Assuming respect implies executional authority.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I substituting permission or status for exposure to consequences and real gating power?*

---

## 9) Representation Literacy
### Compression Limits and Drift

### Definition

**Representation literacy** is the ability to reason about the scope, limits, and failure modes of representations used in execution.

All representations compress.  
All compression fails under drift.

### Core Alphabet

- **representation** vs **reality**
- **fit** vs **overfit**
- **scope** vs **spillover**
- **assumption stability** vs **drift**
- **map usefulness** vs **map authority**

### Failure Signature

- Defending a representation beyond its safe horizon.
- Treating a model or narrative as ground truth.
- Ignoring mismatch signals because the representation is elegant or institutionalized.

### Diagnostic Question

> *Am I defending a representation past its safe execution horizon?*

---

## Dependency Structure

Executional literacies are not independent.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers; higher layers then degrade into narrative substitution, moralization, or performance—because executional validity has been lost.

A typical cascade in **high-coupling execution environments** (not a universal law):

1. Foundational executional literacy collapses (rollback illusion)
2. Constraint literacy collapses (invariants treated as negotiable)
3. Horizon literacy collapses (drift/accumulation ignored)
4. Frame literacy collapses (debate replaces action mapping)
5. Meaning literacy collapses (assumed shared understanding)
6. Coordination literacy collapses (intent-blame replaces structure)
7. Metrics literacy collapses (proxy dominates target)
8. Risk literacy collapses (ruin blindness)
9. Access control literacy collapses (status replaces gating)
10. Representation literacy collapses (maps become sovereign)

---

## Derived Executional Invariant (Not a Literacy)

> **Assume any executing node is load-bearing until proven otherwise.**

This is not ethical.  
It is a risk-dominant structural prior under partial observability and irreversible action:

- False removal errors (breaking a load-bearing node) dominate
- tolerated inefficiency errors (keeping a redundant node)  
when you cannot see the whole system.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:

- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- refusal of non-executable frames,
- willingness to incur deliberate, bounded cost to preserve invariants,
- resistance to narrative substitution.

---

## Examples of “Execution” Outside Code (Non-Exhaustive)

Executional regimes exist wherever actions irreversibly commit shared state, such as:

- contractual commitments and legal exposure,
- capital allocation and operational capacity,
- trust depletion and reputational commitments,
- safety incidents and irreversible harms,
- institutional decisions that create path dependence.

In these domains, “rollback” may exist socially or legally—but it is bounded, delayed, partial, and costly.

---

## Closing

Executional literacies do not guarantee fairness, virtue, or optimality.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution** by preserving the distinctions required for action to remain load-bearing under depletion and drift.

Systems that lack these literacies rarely fail immediately.  
They fail **late**, **expensively**, and **personally**—with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
