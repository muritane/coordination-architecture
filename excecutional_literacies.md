# Executional Literacies  
## A Structural Taxonomy of Stable, Internalized Distinctions

---

## Status and Intent

This document defines a set of **executional literacies** required for coherent
reasoning, coordination, and action in systems operating under:

- bounded resources,
- irreversible execution,
- partial observability,
- environmental drift,
- and non-negotiable constraints.

These literacies are **not**:
- moral virtues,
- intelligence measures,
- personality traits,
- rhetorical skills,
- or indicators of worth.

They are **structural competencies**:  
the ability to maintain specific distinctions *under executional pressure*.

The perspective is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological,
pedagogical, or normative.

---

## Core Principle

A literacy is present when a distinction is:

- available without prompting,
- stable under inconvenience or social pressure,
- action-guiding rather than performative,
- and violated only at explicit cost.

A literacy is absent when a distinction:
- collapses under pressure,
- is acknowledged abstractly but ignored in action,
- or is replaced by narrative, argument, or blame.

Expert judgment recognizes literacy not by declared belief,
but by **which errors no longer occur**.

## Executional Literacy (Foundational)

### Definition

**Executional literacy** is the ability to reason correctly about action
under bounded, irreversible execution in effectively infinite spaces.

It is the base layer on which all other literacies depend.

### Core Distinctions

- existence vs reachability
- evaluation vs traversal
- optimization vs discovery
- halting vs completion
- reversibility in principle vs irreversibility in practice

### Failure Modes

- treating open-world systems as closed-world optimization problems
- demanding global optimality where traversal dominates
- interpreting non-discovery as non-existence or failure

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish
non-negotiable constraints from preferences, tradeoffs, or inconveniences.

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs
- infeasible vs undesirable
- scarcity vs discomfort
- non-negotiable limits vs costly choices

### Failure Modes

- attempting to negotiate with constraints
- moralizing infeasibility
- treating limits as motivation problems

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about
time-indexed validity under drift and irreversible execution.

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability
- stability vs drift
- expiration vs failure
- redesign vs justification

### Failure Modes

- horizon collapse (“works now → works indefinitely”)
- horizon laundering via tradition, identity, or legitimacy
- punishing redesign as inconsistency or betrayal

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

**Frame literacy** is the ability to identify, enter, exit,
or invalidate interaction frames deliberately.

### Core Distinctions

- frame vs argument
- premise vs position
- compliance vs invalidation
- refusal vs premise collapse

### Failure Modes

- arguing inside invalid frames
- supplying correct information to false premises
- interpreting premise invalidation as bad faith

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about
multi-agent systems under shared constraints and misaligned incentives.

### Core Distinctions

- shared goals vs shared incentives
- local rationality vs global failure
- authority vs responsibility
- alignment vs coupling

### Failure Modes

- attributing coordination failure to intent
- assuming cooperation without mechanisms
- optimizing individuals at the expense of system viability

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason about uncertainty,
variance, and irreversibility in outcomes.

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin
- mean outcomes vs tail risk
- recoverable vs terminal loss
- known uncertainty vs unknown structure

### Failure Modes

- optimizing averages while ignoring extinction
- dismissing tail events as noise
- confusing uncertainty with ignorance

---

## Governance Literacy

### Definition

**Governance literacy** is the ability to reason about
rules, enforcement, and redesign under incomplete foresight.

### Core Distinctions

- rules vs implementations
- compliance vs legitimacy
- enforcement vs consent
- reform vs patching

### Failure Modes

- moralizing governance breakdowns
- treating rule violations as character flaws
- resisting redesign to preserve symbolic consistency

---

## Model Literacy (Meta-Literacy)

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about
the limits, scope, and failure modes of representations.

It is a reflective literacy that operates on all others.

### Core Distinctions

- model vs world
- scope vs generality
- signal vs artifact
- critique vs hostility

### Failure Modes

- defending models past their validity horizon
- confusing abstraction failure with personal attack
- mistaking internal coherence for external truth

---

## Dependency Structure

These literacies are not independent.

A typical dependency ordering is:

1. Executional literacy
2. Constraint literacy
3. Horizon literacy
4. Frame literacy
5. Coordination literacy
6. Risk literacy
7. Governance literacy
8. Model literacy

Absence at lower layers destabilizes higher ones,
which then become performative or moralized.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:
- error avoidance,
- distinction stability,
- resistance to collapse under pressure,
- and the ability to incur cost deliberately.

Correctness does not guarantee safety.
Literacy includes knowing when not to exercise it.

---

## Closing

These literacies do not make systems fair, optimal, or humane.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

As environments grow more coupled, dynamic, and constrained,
these literacies become less optional.

Systems that lack them do not fail immediately.
They fail late, expensively, and with misattributed blame.
