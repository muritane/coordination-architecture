# Executional Literacies  
## Structural Alphabets for Reasoning Under Bounded, Irreversible Execution

---

## Status, Scope, and Jurisdiction

This document defines a set of **executional literacies**.

Executional literacies are **not**:
- traits,
- virtues,
- intelligence measures,
- cognitive styles,
- or general reasoning ability.

They are **structural alphabets**:  
minimal systems of distinction that arise **only where reasoning must compile into irreversible action under constraint**.

They specify:
- where reasoning **fails structurally when executed**,
- not what is true, moral, persuasive, justified, or intelligent.

This document does **not evaluate people**.  
It specifies **which distinctions are required in which executional environments**.

Failure to parse a section indicates a **jurisdiction mismatch**,  
not ignorance, irrationality, or lack of goodwill.

---

## Literacy Framing (Critical)

Executional literacies are analogous to **reading and writing systems**, not skills.

No one “knows language” in general.  
They acquire **specific alphabets** under **specific coupling pressures**.

Examples:
- Greek persists due to its coupling to mathematics and formal logic.
- Latin persists due to its coupling to law, medicine, and institutions.
- Version control literacy persists because code executes irreversibly and breaks systems.

Where there is **no executional pressure**,  
there is **no incentive for alphabet acquisition**.

Absence of an executional literacy indicates:
> lack of exposure to irreversible consequence,  
> not a deficit of intelligence or intent.

---

## What This Is Not

Executional literacies are **not**:
- moral positions,
- political theories,
- psychological explanations,
- motivational accounts,
- cultural status markers,
- prescriptions for how people *should* think in general.

They do not explain *why* agents think as they do.  
They do not rank agents.  
They do not assign blame.

They describe **structural failure modes of reasoning under execution**.

---

## What This Is

Executional literacies are **execution-facing distinctions**.

They concern the ability to:
- preserve **load-bearing constraints**,
- maintain **category integrity**,
- refuse **non-executable assumptions**,

*while action is underway and option space is collapsing*.

The unit of analysis is **executional validity**,  
not internal belief, sincerity, or justification.

---

## The Executional Regime  
*(Precondition, Not a Literacy)*

Before any executional literacy can exist,  
a system must already operate within an **executional regime**.

This regime is defined by invariants:

- Actions execute regardless of intent or narrative.
- Each action irreversibly commits state.
- Time, energy, attention, trust, capital, and bandwidth are finite.
- Feedback may be delayed, partial, displaced, or absent.
- Models and metrics decay under drift.
- Systems halt before global evaluation or optimization is possible.

This regime is **not optional** and **not chosen**.

Reasoning that ignores these invariants may be internally coherent,  
but is **non-isomorphic to executable systems**.

Such reasoning cannot safely guide action.

---

## The Load-Bearing Execution Loop

All bounded executors—human, institutional, or technical—operate through a minimal loop:

**sense → model → act**

This loop is structural, not psychological.

- Sensing exists because action may be required.
- Modeling exists because raw data is not executable.
- Action is the reason sensing and modeling exist at all.

Absent pressure to act:
- sensing degrades into observation,
- modeling degrades into interpretation,
- reasoning loses obligation to preserve executability.

Models are **compressions inside the loop**,  
not upstream truth claims.

Model failure appears as **executional breakdown**,  
not merely epistemic error.

---

## Foundational Executional Literacy (Singular)

### Definition

**Foundational executional literacy** is the ability to keep the  
**executional regime load-bearing while reasoning**.

It is the capacity to reason **as if execution were real**,  
even when doing so invalidates:
- preferred explanations,
- moral narratives,
- optimization goals,
- identity commitments,
- or persuasive frames.

This literacy does not optimize outcomes.  
It prevents **non-executable reasoning** from guiding action.

All other executional literacies depend on it.

---

### Core Distinctions Preserved

- reachability vs existence  
- irreversibility vs theoretical reversibility  
- traversal vs evaluation  
- bounded redesign vs infinite correction  
- halting vs global optimality  
- simulation vs execution  

---

### Strategy-Level Contrast

- **Optimizing as if rollback exists**  
  vs  
- **Designing as if every step commits state**

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I reasoning as if time, reversibility, or access were infinite?*

---

## Derived Executional Literacies  
*(Each guards a specific structural failure surface)*

---

## Constraint Literacy

### Definition

**Constraint literacy** is the ability to distinguish  
**non-negotiable constraints** from preferences, tradeoffs, or discomfort.

Constraints are not arguments.  
They are invariants enforced at runtime.

---

### Core Distinctions

- hard constraints vs soft tradeoffs  
- infeasible vs undesirable  
- scarcity vs inconvenience  
- bounded capacity vs lack of motivation  

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I treating an invariant as if it could be negotiated away?*

---

## Horizon Literacy

### Definition

**Horizon literacy** is the ability to reason about  
**time-indexed validity under accumulation, irreversibility, and drift**.

A claim without a horizon is incomplete.

---

### Core Distinctions

- short-horizon sufficiency vs long-horizon viability  
- transient stability vs persistent invariants  
- expiration vs failure  
- redesign vs justification  

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I defending something that has expired because it once worked?*

---

## Frame Literacy

### Definition

A **frame** is a mapping from claims to executable actions.

**Frame literacy** is the ability to recognize:
- what kind of claim is being made,
- and whether the frame can produce **action that survives execution**.

Some frames are internally coherent  
yet structurally incapable of guiding action.

---

### Core Distinctions

- execution claims vs interpretive claims  
- premises vs positions  
- argument success vs execution success  

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Would a correct answer inside this frame still fail to guide action?*

---

## Meaning Literacy  
*(Shared Meaning Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Meaning literacy** is the ability to distinguish  
**internal meaning** from **shared meaning-for-coordination**.

Shared meaning exists only when it is:
- externally addressable,
- substitutable across agents,
- discretized by interfaces,
- admitted into a protocol,
- capable of failing with attributable cost.

Meaning that cannot fail cannot coordinate.

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I assuming shared understanding where no executable protocol exists?*

---

## Coordination Literacy

### Definition

**Coordination literacy** is the ability to reason about  
**multi-agent execution under shared state and irreversible externalities**.

Coordination is imposed by execution, not chosen.

---

### Core Distinctions

- local rationality vs global failure  
- alignment vs coupling  
- authority vs responsibility  

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I blaming intent where structure is load-bearing?*

---

## Metrics Literacy  
*(Evaluation Under Constraint)*

### Definition

**Metrics literacy** is the ability to distinguish  
**internal judgment** from **metrics that are real-for-coordination**.

Metrics consume resources and externalize cost when misaligned.

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Is this metric collapsing distinctions or externalizing cost?*

---

## Risk and Uncertainty Literacy

### Definition

**Risk literacy** is the ability to reason under uncertainty  
where some losses invalidate the evaluation frame itself.

---

### Core Distinctions

- expected value vs ruin  
- mean outcomes vs tail risk  
- recoverable loss vs terminal loss  

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I optimizing averages in a system where tails kill the system?*

---

## Authority, Legitimacy, and Respect Literacy  
*(Access Control Under Shared State)*

### Definition

**Authority literacy** distinguishes:
- permission,
- legitimacy,
- and coordination discount.

These are access-control mechanisms, not virtues.

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I substituting permission or status for exposure to consequences?*

---

## Model Literacy  
*(Meta-Literacy)*

### Definition

**Model literacy** is the ability to reason about  
the scope, limits, and failure modes of representations used in execution.

All models compress.  
All compression fails under drift.

---

### Diagnostic Failure Question

> *Am I defending a model past its safe execution horizon?*

---

## Dependency Structure

Executional literacies are **not independent**.

Lower-layer collapse destabilizes higher layers,  
which then degrade into narrative, moralization, or performance.

Common collapse sequence under pressure:

1. Foundational executional literacy  
2. Constraint literacy  
3. Horizon literacy  
4. Frame literacy  
5. Meaning literacy  
6. Coordination literacy  
7. Metrics literacy  
8. Risk literacy  
9. Authority literacy  
10. Model literacy  

---

## Derived Executional Invariant  
*(Not a Literacy)*

> **Assume any executing node is load-bearing until proven otherwise.**

This is not an ethical claim.  
It is a risk-dominant structural prior.

False removal errors dominate tolerated inefficiency errors  
under partial observability and irreversible action.

---

## Assessment Principle

Executional literacies are not assessed by outcomes alone.

They are assessed by:
- avoidance of structural error,
- stability of distinctions under pressure,
- refusal of non-executable frames,
- willingness to incur deliberate, bounded cost,
- resistance to narrative substitution.

---

## Closing

Executional literacies do not guarantee fairness, optimality, or virtue.

They make systems **legible to themselves under execution**.

Systems that lack them rarely fail immediately.  
They fail **late**, **expensively**,  
with blame assigned where architecture was missing.

Only what executes—and survives depletion—persists.
