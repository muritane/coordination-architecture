# The Load-Bearing Theory Stack

## Coordination, Consequence Topology, Closure, Metrics, Decidability, Agency, and Responsibility

---

## Status

This document presents a **structural and causal model** of how multi-agent systems become load-bearing, how constraints harden, how evaluation becomes executable, where agency can exist, and when responsibility can be legitimately assigned.

The account is **descriptive and diagnostic**, not normative.

It does not prescribe values, justify institutions, or arbitrate legitimacy.
It specifies **what must already be true** for claims about choice, fairness, and responsibility to be structurally meaningful.

---

## A Note on Likely Misreadings (Explicit)

This framework will often feel:

* exculpatory where blame feels emotionally necessary,
* nihilistic where moral narratives are doing coordination work,
* corrosive to common intuitions about consent and responsibility.

This is **not its goal**.
It is a consequence of refusing to let moral language substitute for system architecture.

The framework is meant to be **used diagnostically**, not agreed with or endorsed.

---

## A Note on the Meaning of “Agency” (Explicit)

This framework defines **structural agency only**.

It does **not** address:

* psychological agency,
* phenomenological experience,
* moral responsibility,
* compatibilist free will,
* or virtue.

Structural agency refers solely to:

> the presence or absence of a **real, bounded, decidable decision at a system boundary**.

Other notions of agency may coexist.
They are **out of scope** here.

## Why a Stack Is Necessary

In real systems, distinct questions are routinely collapsed:

* Why does structure suddenly appear?
* Why are these metrics being used?
* Did I really have a choice?
* Who is responsible for the outcome?

These questions belong to **different causal layers**.

When layers are collapsed:

* coordination pressure is mistaken for control,
* metrics are treated as opinions or moral judgments,
* discretion is mistaken for agency,
* responsibility is assigned without declared boundaries.

This document separates these layers **in the order they arise**, and specifies how each depends on the one before it.

---

## Layer 1: Coordination as an Emergent Constraint

*(Why does structure exist at all?)*

Coordination is **not chosen**.
It is **imposed** when certain conditions hold simultaneously.

Coordination pressure emerges if and only if:

* multiple independent agents act,
* their actions affect shared or coupled state,
* information is partial or asymmetric,
* resources are bounded,
* actions are irreversible,
* and failure carries non-trivial cost.

When these conditions hold, **independent action becomes systemically unsafe**.

Coordination is the **minimum structure required** to preserve viability under these conditions.

This layer explains **why structure appears at all** —
before rules, before metrics, before power, before morality.

---

## Layer 2: Exploration and State-Space Probing

*(What is possible before load becomes binding?)*

Before coordination pressure hardens:

* interpretation remains open,
* deviation is cheap,
* failure is local and reversible,
* outcomes can be repaired narratively,
* judgment is internal and context-rich.

Constraints exist but are **undiscovered**.

Evaluation at this stage is:

* heuristic,
* non-comparable,
* non-executable,
* and non-binding.

This is not “early morality.”
It is **pre-execution**.

---

## Layer 3: Consequence Topology and Horizon

*(Where does disturbance go, and over what time?)*

Actions **execute**.

An action invokes an execution path that:

* traverses interfaces,
* consumes finite capacity,
* encounters buffers,
* enforces invariants,
* and injects disturbance into the system.

Interpretation may delay recognition.
It does not alter execution.

### Consequence Topology

**Consequence topology** describes how executable effects propagate after invocation.

It includes:

* path length (latency),
* fan-out (distribution),
* buffering and storage,
* observability and signal attenuation,
* irreversibility gradients.

Topology—not intent—determines:

* where effects appear,
* how delayed they are,
* how attributable they seem,
* and how they accumulate.

### Horizon

A **horizon** specifies the time span over which system viability is evaluated.

Horizons differ:

* milliseconds for control systems,
* days for operations,
* years for infrastructure,
* decades for institutions.

Without a horizon, viability claims are incomplete.

---

## Layer 4: Execution Closure (Constraint Crystallization)

*(What must now be fixed?)*

As coordination load increases and horizons extend, some disturbances dominate viability.

This produces a structural operation:

> **Execution Closure**
> the point at which continued interpretation over certain degrees of freedom becomes unsafe.

Execution closure is not global or binary.

It is:

* domain-specific,
* role-specific,
* horizon-specific.

At execution closure:

* some degrees of freedom must be fixed or bounded,
* interpretation over those DOFs must terminate,
* deviation becomes a failure mode rather than exploration.

Closure explains **why flexibility ends** in specific places and times.

---

## Layer 4b: Settled Closure

*(When constraints disappear into the background)*

When execution closure:

* survives repeated execution,
* proves sufficient across horizons,
* and eliminates alternatives through failure,

closure becomes **settled**.

**Settled closure** is execution closure that has ceased to appear as a decision.

At settled closure:

* degrees of freedom are no longer argued about,
* metrics feel natural or descriptive rather than imposed,
* disagreement shifts *within* the representation, not about its existence.

Settled closure explains why some constraints feel neutral or apolitical:

* not because they are value-free,
* but because topology and execution have already selected them.

Settled closure is always **domain- and horizon-specific**.

Mistaking local settled closure for global necessity is a common failure mode.

---

## Layer 5: Metrics Under Constraint

*(When evaluation becomes executable)*

Once execution closure occurs over a set of DOFs, evaluation must coordinate action.

At this point, **metrics emerge** as executable artifacts.

A metric is not a truth claim or value judgment.
It is an **interface**.

A metric is real-for-evaluation only if it:

* captures the **minimally sufficient degrees of freedom** required to bound invariant pressure over the horizon,
* is finite, discrete, and resource-bounded,
* can be applied by substituted evaluators,
* yields determinate outcomes,
* survives repeated execution,
* and fails explicitly when misapplied or saturated.

Metrics never claim absolutes.
They operate over **ranges**, resolutions, and declared limits.

### Internal Judgment vs Shared Metrics (Explicit)

* **Internal judgment** is local, unconstrained, non-comparable.
* **Shared metrics** are constrained, externalized, executable.

Metrics do not capture everything.
They capture **what must be fixed to remain viable**.

Disputes about “fairness” often reflect mismatches in:

* topology,
* horizon,
* or degree-of-freedom selection.

---

## Layer 6: Decidability and Agency at Boundaries

*(Who is legitimately bound?)*

Agency exists **only at declared boundaries**, before entry into execution.

Structural agency requires **decidability**.

Decidability is:

> the presence of explicit, bounded execution paths with known resource limits, failure semantics, and exit conditions.

A decision is decidable only if:

* acceptance and refusal are both real execution paths,
* consequences are finite and specifiable,
* evaluation criteria are explicit,
* and execution is interruptible.

Systems that imply:

* infinite horizon,
* infinite resolution,
* absolute evaluation,
* or unbounded obligation,

are **structurally undecidable**.

Entry into such systems cannot constitute agency.

### Discretion Is Not Agency (Explicit)

Inside execution:

* actors may optimize locally,
* choose methods,
* exercise judgment.

This is **discretion**, not agency.

Agency decides **whether to be bound**.
Discretion operates **after binding**.

Resistance, exit, or disruption are real actions,
but they are **interventions at execution surfaces**, not agency within the declared execution frame.

---

## Layer 7: Responsibility as Load Attribution

*(Where can responsibility be assigned?)*

Responsibility is not moral blame.
Responsibility is **load location**.

Responsibility can be assigned only when:

* coordination pressure exists,
* execution closure has occurred,
* metrics are executable and bounded,
* entry was decidable,
* and outcomes depend on variables the actor controlled.

When these conditions fail, responsibility claims are **structurally undefined**.

Moral language often appears here to compensate for missing architecture.

---

## Power and Governance (Structural, Not Normative)

Power is not exemption from execution.

Power is the capacity to:

* reassign disturbance,
* shift buffer ownership,
* select horizons,
* displace cost across nodes or time.

Governance emerges because:

* consequence topology must be actively managed,
* buffers must be sized and owned,
* horizons must be chosen,
* invariant pressure must be routed.

This framework explains **when governance questions become unavoidable**.
It does not answer them.

---

## Dependency Summary (Plain Language)

* Coordination pressure makes structure necessary.
* Topology and horizon determine where disturbance matters.
* Execution closure fixes which DOFs must harden.
* Settled closure hides those fixes.
* Metrics encode bounded DOFs.
* Decidability enables agency at entry.
* Responsibility follows declared load.

Skipping steps produces confusion:

* fairness claims without metrics,
* agency claims inside execution,
* responsibility without boundaries,
* moral absolutes in finite systems.

---

## Closing Note

This framework does not deny morality.
It denies that morality can replace architecture.

Actions execute.
Execution propagates.
Topology asserts.
Constraints harden.
Closure settles.
Metrics crystallize.
Decidability gates entry.
Agency exists at boundaries.
Responsibility follows load.

Narratives may delay recognition.
Topology and time do not negotiate.

Only what executes persists.
