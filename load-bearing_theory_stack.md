# The Load-Bearing Theory Stack  
## A Structural Model for Exploration, Constraint, Agency, and Responsibility

---

## Status

This document defines a **layered structural model** for analyzing systems that move from exploration into load-bearing execution.

It is **descriptive and architectural**, not prescriptive.

The model specifies:
- when constraints become unavoidable,
- where agency can exist,
- and when responsibility can be structurally assigned.

It does **not** argue what should be valued, permitted, or justified.

---

## A Note on Interpretation (Read First)

This framework will invalidate some **common moral intuitions** about choice, consent, and responsibility.

That is **not its goal**.  
It is a *consequence* of describing systems in structural rather than moral terms.

Readers may feel that the framework is:
- corrective,
- dismissive of lived experience,
- or hostile to resistance narratives.

Those reactions are understandable, but they are **orthogonal** to the purpose of the model.

This framework is intended to be **used**, not agreed with.

## Why This Document Exists

In discussions of systems, people often collapse distinct questions into one:

- “Why are there rules now?”
- “Did I have a choice?”
- “Who is responsible?”
- “Is this fair?”

These questions do not operate at the same structural level.

When they are mixed:
- constraint is moralized,
- agency is asserted where only execution exists,
- responsibility is assigned without declared boundaries,
- and disagreement becomes moral rather than diagnostic.

This document separates these questions into **explicit layers**, each with a single job.

Each layer depends on the one below it.  
No layer can substitute for another.

---

## Layer: Exploration and State-Space Probing  
*(Question answered: what is possible?)*

This is the phase where a domain is **not yet load-bearing**.

Characteristics:

- interpretation remains open,
- standards are ambiguous or absent,
- deviation is cheap,
- failure is local and reversible,
- outcomes can be repaired narratively,
- coordination costs are low.

In this phase:

- constraints exist but are **undiscovered**,
- enforcement is absent or symbolic,
- execution does not substitute for others,
- irreversible commitments are avoided.

Exploration is **learning under uncertainty**, not rule-following.

At this layer:
- agency is not yet meaningful,
- responsibility is not assignable,
- boundaries are soft or provisional.

This layer supports discovery, not execution.

---

## Layer: Constraint Discovery and Becoming Load-Bearing  
*(Question answered: what constraints become unavoidable under load?)*  
*(Requires: exploration has already occurred)*

A domain becomes **load-bearing** when failure ceases to be local and begins to affect others.

This occurs when the domain starts to:

- coordinate independent actors,
- allocate shared resources,
- substitute operators, evaluators, or components,
- propagate failure across boundaries,
- commit action in irreversible time.

At this point:

- ambiguity becomes dangerous,
- deviation cost grows non-linearly,
- interpretation must terminate at interfaces,
- invariants emerge,
- enforcement enters the execution loop.

Constraints are **not invented** here.  
They are **revealed by execution under load**.

A key operation at this layer is **collapse of degrees of freedom**:
some ways of acting must be fixed, bounded, or excluded for execution to remain stable.

This layer explains **why flexibility ends**.  
It does not yet explain **who is bound**.

---

## Layer: Agency and Decidability at Boundaries  
*(Question answered: who is legitimately bound once constraints apply?)*  
*(Requires: the system is already load-bearing)*

Agency exists **only at explicit boundaries**, at the moment of entry into a load-bearing system.

Agency is defined as:

> the capacity to make a **binding yes/no decision** to enter execution,  
> with explicit knowledge of which constraints, interfaces, and failure semantics will apply after entry.

This requires **decidability**:

- a real option to say yes,
- a real option to say no,
- with known and **bounded** consequences for each.

If refusal is technically possible but practically catastrophic,  
then decidability is invalid and agency is absent.

This explicitly includes:
- power asymmetry,
- economic pressure,
- scarcity,
- and dependency.

A choice under unbounded penalty is **not agency**, regardless of formal voluntariness.

---

### Discretion vs Agency (Explicit Distinction)

Inside execution, systems may allow:
- flexibility,
- judgment,
- local optimization,
- or choice among methods.

This is **discretion**, not agency.

**Agency decides whether to be bound.**  
**Discretion decides how to comply once bound.**

Conflating the two is a common source of confusion.

---

### What Must Be Declared for Agency to Exist

For a boundary to support agency, the system must explicitly declare:

- which constraints are fixed and enforced,
- which variations are permitted and within what bounds,
- which constraints are deferred to future versions,
- which factors are irrelevant,
- and which uncertainties are excluded from responsibility.

If these are not declared:
- consent is not meaningful,
- refusal is not real,
- agency does not exist.

Once the boundary is crossed:
- interpretation terminates,
- negotiation closes,
- behavior becomes execution under constraint.

---

## Layer: Responsibility and Load Attribution  
*(Question answered: where can responsibility be assigned without moralization?)*  
*(Requires: agency-valid entry has occurred)*

Responsibility is not blame.  
Responsibility is **load location**.

Responsibility can be assigned **only if**:

- the system is load-bearing,
- entry was decidable,
- constraints were declared at entry,
- outcomes depend on variables the agent controlled.

If harm arises from:
- undeclared constraints,
- misrepresented boundaries,
- unknown failure modes,
- or absence of real refusal,

then responsibility was **misrouted**.

Moral language often appears here,  
but it is compensating for missing structure.

---

## On Partial or Structured Agency (Clarification)

This framework treats agency as **binary by design**:
present at the boundary or absent.

Some systems intentionally implement structured variants, such as:
- time-limited consent,
- revocable participation,
- contingent or probabilistic entry.

These are not counterexamples.  
They are **explicitly engineered boundary designs**.

If such structures are declared, agency remains intact.  
If they are implicit or retroactive, agency fails.

---

## On Who Declares Constraints (Explicitly Out of Scope)

This framework requires that constraints be declared,  
but it does **not** specify:

- who has authority to declare them,
- how disputes over declarations are resolved,
- or how legitimacy is established.

Those questions belong to governance, law, or politics.

This model evaluates **whether agency and responsibility claims are structurally valid given a declaration**, not whether the declaration itself is justified.

---

## How the Layers Depend on Each Other

These layers cannot be rearranged:

- responsibility requires agency,
- agency requires declared constraints,
- declared constraints require load-bearing execution,
- load-bearing execution emerges from exploration.

However:
- exploration does not guarantee constraint,
- constraint does not guarantee agency,
- agency does not guarantee responsibility.

Most real-world failures occur when:
- responsibility is asserted without agency,
- agency is claimed inside execution,
- or constraint is denied after load arrives.

---

## Closing Note

This framework does not tell you what to value.

It tells you **where certain claims stop making sense**.

Exploration ends when load arrives.  
Agency exists at entry.  
Execution enforces invariants.  
Responsibility follows declared load.

When these distinctions are held, systems become legible.  
When they are collapsed, moral noise fills the gaps.
