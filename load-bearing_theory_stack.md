# The Load-Bearing Theory Stack  
## A Human-First Structural Model for Exploration, Constraint, Agency, and Responsibility

---

## Status

This document defines a **layered structural model** for understanding:

- when a domain stops being exploratory,
- when constraints become unavoidable,
- where agency can exist,
- and when responsibility can be legitimately assigned.

The model is **descriptive, architectural, and non-normative**.

It does not argue what *should* happen.  
It specifies what *must already be true* for certain claims to make sense.

---

## Why This Document Exists

Complex systems often collapse distinct questions into one:

- *“Is this fair?”*
- *“Did I have a choice?”*
- *“Who is responsible?”*
- *“Why are there rules now?”*

These questions **belong to different structural layers**.

When they are mixed:
- agency is asserted where none exists,
- responsibility is assigned without boundaries,
- constraint is moralized,
- and resistance is framed as interpretation after execution has begun.

This document separates those layers **explicitly and sequentially**.

Each layer answers **one question only**  
and depends on the layers below it.

---

## Layer 1: Exploration and State-Space Probing  
*(What is possible?)*

This is the phase where a domain is **not yet load-bearing**.

Characteristics:

- interpretation remains open,
- standards are ambiguous or absent,
- deviation is cheap,
- failure is local and reversible,
- outcomes can be repaired narratively,
- coordination costs are low.

In this phase:

- constraints exist but are **undiscovered**,
- enforcement is absent or symbolic,
- execution does not substitute for others,
- no irreversible commitments are made.

Exploration is **learning under uncertainty**, not rule-following.

At this stage:
- agency is undefined,
- responsibility is meaningless,
- boundaries are soft.

This layer enables discovery, not execution.

---

## Layer 2: Constraint Discovery and Becoming Load-Bearing  
*(What constraints become unavoidable under load?)*  
*(Requires: exploration already occurred)*

A domain becomes **load-bearing** when failure stops being local and begins to affect others.

This happens when the domain starts to:

- coordinate independent actors,
- allocate shared resources,
- substitute operators, evaluators, or components,
- propagate failure across boundaries,
- commit action in irreversible time.

At this point:

- ambiguity becomes dangerous,
- deviation cost grows non-linearly,
- interpretation must terminate at interfaces,
- invariants emerge,
- enforcement enters the execution loop.

Constraints are **not invented** here.  
They are **revealed by execution under load**.

A key operation at this layer is **collapse of degrees of freedom**:
some ways of acting must be fixed, others must be bounded, or execution fails.

This layer explains **why rules appear**.  
It does not yet say **who is bound by them**.

---

## Layer 3: Agency and Decidability at Boundaries  
*(Who is legitimately bound once constraints apply?)*  
*(Requires: the system is already load-bearing)*

Agency exists **only at declared boundaries** where entry decisions are made.

Agency is defined as:

> the capacity to make a **binding yes/no decision** to enter a load-bearing system,  
> with explicit knowledge of what will be fixed, enforced, and owned after entry.

This requires **decidability**:

- the option to say yes,
- the option to say no,
- with known and bounded consequences for each.

For a boundary to support agency, the system must explicitly declare:

- which degrees of freedom are **fixed and enforced**,
- which are **delegated within limits**,
- which are **preserved for future versions**,
- which are **irrelevant and collapsed**,
- and which are **unknown and excluded**.

If these are not declared:
- consent is not meaningful,
- refusal is not real,
- agency is absent.

Once the boundary is crossed:

- interpretation terminates,
- negotiation closes,
- behavior becomes execution under constraint.

Inside execution, **there is no agency** — only compliance or failure.

---

## Layer 4: Responsibility and Load Attribution  
*(Where can responsibility be assigned without moralization?)*  
*(Requires: agency-valid entry already occurred)*

Responsibility is not blame.  
Responsibility is **load location**.

Responsibility can be assigned **only** when all of the following are true:

- the system is load-bearing,
- the entry boundary was decidable,
- the relevant constraints were declared at entry,
- the outcome depends on degrees of freedom the agent controlled.

If harm arises from:

- unknown constraints,
- misrepresented boundaries,
- latent constraints that collapsed later,
- or lack of a real refusal option,

then responsibility was **misrouted**.

Moral language is often used to cover this failure,  
but it is not required to diagnose it.

---

## How the Layers Depend on Each Other

These layers are **not interchangeable**.

- Responsibility requires agency.
- Agency requires declared constraints.
- Declared constraints only exist once the system is load-bearing.
- Load-bearing systems only emerge after exploration.

However:

- exploration does **not** guarantee constraint,
- constraint does **not** guarantee agency,
- agency does **not** guarantee responsibility.

Most systemic confusion arises when:
- responsibility is asserted without agency,
- agency is claimed inside execution,
- or constraint is denied after load has arrived.

---

## Versioning and Time

Across time, systems change.

Versioning is the mechanism that keeps agency real by:

- declaring when constraints may change,
- bounding how long consent applies,
- providing migration or exit paths,
- preventing silent reclassification of constraints.

Without versioning:

- latent constraints harden invisibly,
- consent becomes permanent,
- participation turns into entrapment,
- responsibility becomes indefinite.

Versioning is how systems remain honest across time.

---

## Relationship to the Other Documents

- The **constraint discovery** document explains *when and why* systems harden.
- The **agency and decidability** document explains *who is bound and how*.
- This document explains **how those explanations fit together without collapse**.

Each document stands alone.  
Together, they form a coherent structural framework.

## Closing Note

Not everything that feels like choice is agency.  
Not every rule is oppression.  
Not every failure deserves blame.

Exploration ends when load arrives.  
Agency lives at entry.  
Execution enforces invariants.  
Responsibility follows declared load.

When these are separated, systems become legible.  
When they are mixed, moral noise fills the gaps.
