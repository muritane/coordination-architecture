# The Load-Bearing Theory Stack  
## A Structural Model for Exploration, Constraint, Metrics, Agency, and Responsibility

---

## Status

This document defines a **layered structural model** for analyzing systems that move from exploration into load-bearing execution.

It is **descriptive and architectural**, not normative.

The model specifies:
- when domains harden under load,
- when evaluation becomes objective-for-coordination,
- where agency can exist,
- and when responsibility can be structurally assigned.

It does **not** define value, merit, justice, or legitimacy.

---

## A Note on Moral Readings (Explicit)

This framework will invalidate many **common moral intuitions** about choice, fairness, consent, and blame.

That outcome is **not a goal**.  
It is a consequence of describing systems in terms of execution, constraints, and observability rather than intent or virtue.

Readers may disagree with the conclusions.  
The framework is intended to be **used diagnostically**, not endorsed philosophically.

---

## Why a Layered Model Is Necessary

In real systems, people often collapse distinct questions into one:

- “Why are there rules now?”
- “Is this evaluation fair?”
- “Did I really have a choice?”
- “Who is responsible?”

These questions belong to **different structural layers**.

When they are mixed:
- constraint is moralized,
- metrics are treated as opinions,
- agency is asserted inside execution,
- responsibility is assigned without declared boundaries.

This document separates these questions into **explicit layers**, each answering one question only, and each depending on the layers below it.

---

## Layer: Exploration and State-Space Probing  
*(Question answered: what is possible?)*

This is the phase where a domain is **not yet load-bearing**.

Characteristics:

- interpretation remains open,
- standards are ambiguous or absent,
- deviation is cheap,
- failure is local and reversible,
- outcomes can be repaired narratively,
- coordination costs are low.

Constraints exist but are **undiscovered**.  
Evaluation is internal, informal, and non-comparable.

At this stage:
- metrics are heuristic,
- agency is not yet meaningful,
- responsibility is not assignable.

Exploration supports **learning**, not execution.

---

## Layer: Constraint Discovery and Becoming Load-Bearing  
*(Question answered: what constraints become unavoidable under load?)*  
*(Requires: exploration has occurred)*

A domain becomes **load-bearing** when failure ceases to be local and begins to propagate.

This occurs when the domain starts to:

- coordinate independent actors,
- allocate shared resources,
- substitute operators or evaluators,
- propagate failure across boundaries,
- commit action in irreversible time.

At this point:

- ambiguity becomes dangerous,
- deviation cost grows non-linearly,
- interpretation must terminate at interfaces,
- invariants emerge,
- enforcement enters the execution loop.

A key operation here is **collapse of degrees of freedom**:
some variability must be fixed or bounded for execution to remain stable.

This layer explains **why constraints appear**.  
It does not yet determine **how evaluation works** or **who is bound**.

---

## Layer: Metrics Under Constraint (Objective Evaluation)  
*(Question answered: when does evaluation become comparable-for-coordination?)*  
*(Requires: the system is load-bearing)*

Metrics emerge as **system-level artifacts** only after a domain becomes load-bearing.

A metric is not a belief or a value judgment.  
It is an **executable evaluative artifact** that must function under constraint.

A metric becomes real-for-evaluation only if it:

- can be applied by substituted evaluators,
- yields determinate outcomes under a protocol,
- supports repeated application at scale,
- operates under bounded resources,
- and incurs meaningful failure cost when misapplied.

Metrics that require reinterpretation to survive are **non-executable**.  
They may still function as internal judgment.

---

### Internal Judgment vs Shared Metrics (Explicit Boundary)

- **Internal judgment** is local, context-rich, non-comparable, and unconstrained.
- **Shared metrics** externalize judgment, terminate interpretation, and enable coordination.

Evaluation that cannot fail cannot coordinate.  
Evaluation that survives only through reinterpretation has failed as a metric.

This layer provides the **objective anchor** for later claims about fairness, agency, and responsibility.

---

### Metrics and Power Asymmetry

Metrics implicitly encode:

- resource constraints,
- observability limits,
- coordination cost,
- and failure surfaces.

If a metric assumes conditions that only some actors can meet,  
that asymmetry is **structural**, not moral.

Claims of “fairness” or “objectivity” without constraint-aligned metrics are undefined-for-comparison.

---

## Layer: Agency and Decidability at Boundaries  
*(Question answered: who is legitimately bound?)*  
*(Requires: load-bearing execution and executable metrics)*

Agency exists **only at explicit boundaries**, before entry into execution.

Agency is defined as:

> the capacity to make a **binding yes/no decision** to enter a load-bearing system,  
> with explicit knowledge of constraints, metrics, and failure semantics that will apply after entry.

This requires **decidability**:

- refusal must be real,
- consequences must be bounded and known,
- metrics governing evaluation must be declared.

If refusal is formally allowed but practically catastrophic,  
then decisibility is invalid and agency is absent.

This includes cases of:
- economic pressure,
- scarcity,
- dependency,
- or asymmetric exposure to metric failure.

---

### Discretion vs Agency (Non-Ambiguous)

Once execution begins:

- agents may have discretion in how they comply,
- but discretion is **not agency**.

**Agency decides whether to be bound.**  
**Discretion operates within binding.**

Metrics govern discretion;  
they do not create agency.

---

## Layer: Responsibility and Load Attribution  
*(Question answered: where can responsibility be assigned?)*  
*(Requires: agency-valid entry and executable metrics)*

Responsibility is **not blame**.  
Responsibility is **load location under declared constraints and metrics**.

Responsibility can be assigned only if:

- the system is load-bearing,
- evaluation is metric-executable,
- entry was decidable,
- outcomes depend on variables the agent controlled.

If harm arises from:
- undeclared metrics,
- mis-specified constraint regimes,
- metric failure under scale,
- or absence of real refusal,

then responsibility was misrouted.

Moral language often appears here to compensate for missing structure.

---

## On Partial, Time-Limited, or Probabilistic Agency

This framework treats agency as **binary at the boundary by design**.

Some systems intentionally engineer:
- time-bounded consent,
- revocable participation,
- probabilistic entry (e.g. auctions, contingent contracts).

These are not counterexamples.  
They are **explicit boundary designs**.

If declared, agency is preserved.  
If implicit or retroactive, agency fails.

---

## On Who Declares Constraints and Metrics (Explicitly Out of Scope)

This framework does not specify:

- who has authority to declare constraints or metrics,
- how disputes over declarations are resolved,
- or how legitimacy is established.

Those questions belong to governance and politics.

This model evaluates **whether claims of objectivity, agency, or responsibility are structurally valid given a declaration**, not whether the declaration is justified.

---

## Dependency Summary (Non-Symbolic)

- Responsibility requires agency.
- Agency requires declared constraints and metrics.
- Metrics require load-bearing execution.
- Load-bearing execution emerges from exploration.

Skipping layers produces confusion:
- fairness claims without metrics,
- agency claims inside execution,
- responsibility without boundaries.

---

## Closing Note

Metrics do not make systems just.  
Agency does not make systems fair.  
Constraint does not imply legitimacy.

But without:
- constraint discovery,
- executable metrics,
- decidable boundaries,

claims about fairness, choice, and responsibility are **structurally undefined**.

This framework exists to say **where claims stop making sense**,  
not which claims should win.
