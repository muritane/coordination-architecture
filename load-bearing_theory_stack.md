# The Load-Bearing Theory Stack  
## A Structural Account of Why Coordination, Metrics, Agency, and Responsibility Exist at All

---

## Status

This document defines a **causal and architectural model** for systems in which:

- multiple agents act,
- resources are bounded,
- consequences are irreversible,
- and failure propagates.

It explains:
- why coordination emerges,
- why constraints harden,
- when evaluation becomes objective-for-coordination,
- where agency can exist,
- and when responsibility can be structurally assigned.

The model is **descriptive, not normative**.

It does not tell you what should be valued, justified, or endorsed.  
It tells you **what must already be true** for certain claims to make sense.

## A Note on Likely Misreadings (Explicit)

This framework will often feel:

- exculpatory in cases where blame feels emotionally necessary,
- nihilistic where moral narratives are doing coordination work,
- corrosive to common intuitions about consent and responsibility.

This is **not an argument against morality**.  
It is a refusal to let moral language substitute for system architecture.

The framework is intended to be **used diagnostically**, not agreed with.

---

## A Note on the Meaning of “Agency” (Explicit)

This framework defines **structural agency**, not:

- psychological agency,
- phenomenological agency,
- moral responsibility,
- or compatibilist free will.

Structural agency refers only to:
> whether an actor had a **real, bounded decision at a system boundary**.

Other notions of agency may coexist.  
They are **out of scope** here.

## Why a Stack Is Necessary at All

Readers often collapse these questions into one:

- “Why do rules suddenly exist?”
- “Why am I being measured this way?”
- “Did I really have a choice?”
- “Who is responsible?”

These questions belong to **different causal layers**.

When the layers are collapsed:
- coordination pressure is mistaken for control,
- metrics are treated as opinions,
- discretion is mistaken for agency,
- and responsibility is assigned where no boundary existed.

This document separates those layers **in the order they arise**.

## Layer: Coordination as an Emergent Constraint  
*(Question answered: why does structure appear at all?)*

Coordination is **not chosen**.  
It is **imposed** when certain conditions hold.

Coordination pressure emerges **if and only if**:

- multiple independent agents act,
- their actions affect shared or coupled state,
- information is partial or asymmetric,
- resources are bounded,
- actions are irreversible,
- and failure carries non-trivial cost.

When all of these conditions hold simultaneously,  
**independent action becomes systemically unsafe**.

Coordination is the **minimum structure required** to preserve system viability under these conditions.

This layer explains **why structure appears at all** —  
before rules, before metrics, before power, before morality.

---

## Layer: Exploration and State-Space Probing  
*(Question answered: what is possible before coordination hardens?)*

Before coordination pressure becomes binding:

- interpretation remains open,
- deviation is cheap,
- failure is local and reversible,
- outcomes can be repaired narratively,
- judgment is internal and context-rich.

Constraints exist but are **undiscovered**.

Evaluation at this stage is:
- heuristic,
- non-comparable,
- non-executable,
- and non-binding.

This is not “early morality.”  
It is **pre-execution**.

---

## Layer: Constraint Discovery and Execution Closure  
*(Question answered: what must now be fixed?)*  
*(Requires: coordination pressure is present)*

As coordination load increases, systems encounter limits.

This produces a predictable operation:

> **Execution Closure**  
> (also called constraint crystallization or interpretive collapse)

Execution closure occurs when:
- interpretation must terminate,
- degrees of freedom collapse,
- invariants harden,
- and deviation becomes a failure mode.

This is not ideological.  
It is a response to propagation of error under load.

This layer explains **why flexibility ends**.

---

## Layer: Metrics Under Constraint  
*(Question answered: when does evaluation become objective-for-coordination?)*  
*(Requires: execution closure has occurred)*

Once execution matters at scale, evaluation must coordinate action.

At this point, **metrics emerge** as executable artifacts.

A metric is real-for-evaluation only if it:

- can be applied by substituted evaluators,
- yields determinate outcomes,
- operates under bounded resources,
- survives repeated application,
- and can fail meaningfully when misapplied.

Metrics are **interfaces**, not truths.

---

### Internal Judgment vs Shared Metrics (Early and Explicit)

- **Internal judgment** is unconstrained, local, non-comparable.
- **Shared metrics** are constrained, externalized, and executable.

Internal judgment does not scale.  
Shared metrics do not capture everything.

Confusing these produces most “fairness” disputes.

---

## Layer: Agency and Decidability at Boundaries  
*(Question answered: who is legitimately bound?)*  
*(Requires: executable metrics and declared constraints)*

Agency exists **only at the moment of entry** into execution.

Structural agency is:

> the capacity to make a **binding yes/no decision**  
> to enter a system whose constraints and metrics are declared in advance.

This requires **decidability**:

- refusal must be real,
- consequences must be bounded and known,
- evaluation criteria must be declared.

If refusal is technically allowed but practically catastrophic,  
agency is absent.

This includes cases of:
- economic pressure,
- scarcity,
- dependency,
- asymmetric exposure to metric failure.

---

### Discretion Is Not Agency (Explicit)

Inside execution:
- agents may exercise judgment,
- optimize locally,
- or choose methods.

This is **discretion**, not agency.

Agency decides **whether to be bound**.  
Discretion operates **after binding**.

---

## Layer: Responsibility as Load Attribution  
*(Question answered: where can responsibility be assigned?)*  
*(Requires: agency-valid entry)*

Responsibility is not moral blame.  
It is **load location**.

Responsibility can be assigned only when:

- coordination pressure exists,
- execution is closed,
- metrics are executable,
- entry was decidable,
- outcomes depend on controlled variables.

When these conditions fail, responsibility claims are **structurally undefined**.

Moral language often appears here to compensate.

---

## On Power, Governance, and Legitimacy (Explicit Scope)

This framework does **not** decide:

- who should declare constraints,
- which metrics are legitimate,
- or which coordination media are justified.

Those are governance questions.

This framework can be **embedded inside** political or legal analysis,  
but it does not arbitrate them.

It answers a narrower question:

> Given a declared structure, are claims about agency, fairness, and responsibility structurally coherent?

---

## Dependency Summary (Plain Language)

- Coordination pressure makes structure necessary.
- Structure produces execution closure.
- Execution closure requires metrics.
- Metrics make agency decidable.
- Agency enables responsibility.

Skipping steps produces confusion.

---

## Closing Note

This framework does not deny morality.  
It denies that morality can replace architecture.

Coordination is imposed by reality.  
Constraints harden under load.  
Metrics enable comparison.  
Agency exists at entry.  
Responsibility follows declared load.

When these are distinguished, systems become legible.  
When they are collapsed, disagreement becomes moral noise.
