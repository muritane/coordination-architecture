# Load‑Bearing Stack: A Structural Account of Bounded Execution

## Status and Scope

This document specifies a **minimal, descriptive execution architecture** for bounded systems: how they act, absorb consequences, harden constraints, articulate boundaries, and remain viable under drift.

It is **not** a theory of:

* human psychology,
* intelligence, intent, or consciousness,
* morality, legitimacy, or justice,
* preference formation or value prescription.

It applies wherever:

* execution is irreversible,
* resources are bounded,
* environments are non‑stationary,
* and repeated action must remain viable.

The stack does **not** prescribe goals. It specifies the **structural preconditions** that must already hold for claims about action, agency, responsibility, evaluation, or optimization to be coherent at all.

---

## Primitive Commitments (Non‑Negotiable Constraints)

All subsequent structure follows from these constraints:

1. **Execution is irreversible.** Acting destroys information and eliminates alternatives.
2. **Resources are bounded.** No system can sense, model, interpret, or act on everything.
3. **Environments drift.** Invariants are provisional and regime‑dependent.
4. **Compression is unavoidable.** Efficiency is purchased by blindness.
5. **Viability precedes optimization.** A system must remain capable of further execution and redesign.

These are not assumptions. They are structural facts.

---

## Structural Separations (Do Not Collapse)

Pathologies arise when the following distinctions are collapsed:

* execution vs interpretation
* existence vs persistence vs scale
* exploration vs exploitation vs redesign
* regulation vs control
* discretion vs agency
* evaluation vs optimization

The stack is organized to **preserve articulation** across these separations under pressure.

---

## Layer 0: Existence (Emergent Coherence)

A system **exists** when a coherent execution pattern emerges from lower‑layer interactions.

Existence requires:

* sufficient coupling to lower‑layer dynamics,
* internal constraint structure,
* non‑immediate decoherence.

Existence does **not** require:

* stability,
* persistence,
* intention,
* optimization,
* recognition.

Existence already implies an implicit sense–model–act coupling enforced by physical or logical constraint.

---

## Layer 1: Coordination Pressure

Coordination is not chosen. It emerges when:

* multiple independent processes execute,
* execution affects shared or coupled state,
* information is partial or asymmetric,
* resources are bounded,
* actions are irreversible,
* failure carries non‑trivial cost.

Under these conditions, independent execution becomes unsafe.

**Coordination pressure** is the minimum additional structure required for continued viability.

### Displacement and Masking

Coordination pressure may be:

* **buffered** (delayed by storage, slack, or latency),
* **subsidized** (absorbed by external systems),
* **displaced** (exported to other actors or layers),
* **masked** (hidden by metrics that defer failure).

Apparent absence of coordination pressure is often evidence of **displacement**, not resolution.

---

## Layer 2: Optionality Preservation (Exploration Regime)

Where coordination load has not yet bound locally:

* interpretation remains open,
* deviation is cheap,
* failure is local and largely reversible,
* information is preserved rather than destroyed.

Evaluation in this regime is:

* heuristic,
* context‑rich,
* non‑comparable,
* non‑executable.

This is **not a temporal stage**.

Optionality preservation can re‑enter locally in mature systems wherever closure has not yet hardened (e.g., sandboxes, exception paths, redesign boundaries).

Optionality disappears only where execution has already closed.

---

## Layer 3: Execution and Consequence Topology

Action executes.

Execution propagates through a **consequence topology** defined by:

* path length (latency),
* fan‑out (distribution),
* buffers and storage,
* observability and attenuation,
* irreversibility gradients.

Interpretation may lag.
Intent does not propagate.
Only execution persists.

### Horizons

A **horizon** specifies the timescale over which viability is evaluated.

Topology and horizon jointly determine:

* where disturbance appears,
* where it accumulates,
* where it dissipates,
* and where it becomes invisible.

Systems typically operate across **multiple, partially incompatible horizons**. Selecting which horizon binds execution is itself a **closure decision**.

---

## Layer 4: Execution Closure (Deliberate Compression)

As coordination pressure increases and horizons extend, continued interpretation over all distinctions becomes unsafe.

**Execution closure** is the deliberate termination of interpretation over selected distinctions so that repeated execution remains viable.

Closure is:

* domain‑specific,
* role‑specific,
* horizon‑specific.

Closure is not optional. It is the cost of acting repeatedly without collapse.

---

## Transition: Closure Stabilization (Settled Closure)

When execution closure:

* survives repeated execution,
* remains sufficient across relevant horizons,
* eliminates alternatives through failure rather than choice,

it becomes **settled**.

At settled closure:

* distinctions cease to appear as choices,
* constraints feel descriptive rather than imposed,
* disagreement occurs within the representation, not about it.

Settled closure is always local, contingent, and revisable under drift.

---

## Layer 5: Metrics as Executable Interfaces

Once closure occurs, evaluation must coordinate execution.

**Metrics** are executable interfaces that encode compressed distinctions.

A metric is real‑for‑execution only if it:

* captures minimally sufficient degrees of freedom,
* is finite and resource‑bounded,
* is operationally substitutable within the closure regime,
* yields determinate outcomes,
* fails explicitly when saturated or misapplied.

Metrics do not encode truth.
They encode **what must be held fixed for viability over a horizon**.

Articulated values that never bind compression remain narratively visible but execution‑inert.

---

## Layer 6: Decidability and Agency Boundaries

Agency exists only at **decidable boundaries**, prior to execution.

Decidability requires:

* explicit execution paths,
* bounded consequences,
* known failure semantics,
* interruptibility.

A decision is decidable only if **acceptance and refusal are both real execution paths**.

Decidability is necessarily **symmetric across coupled actors**. If one party retains refusal while another does not, agency attribution is structurally invalid.

Inside execution, actors exercise **discretion**, not agency.

---

## Layer 7: Responsibility as Load Attribution

Responsibility is not moral blame. It is **load location** within an execution topology.

Responsibility can be coherently assigned only when:

* coordination pressure exists,
* execution closure has occurred,
* metrics are bounded and executable,
* entry was decidable,
* outcomes depend on controlled variables.

Absent these conditions, responsibility claims are structurally undefined.

---

## Dynamic Operation: Regulation and Control

Viable systems separate:

* **Regulation**: settled, low‑cost background execution over closed distinctions.
* **Control**: costly, adaptive intervention near redesign boundaries.

Regulation absorbs the known.
Control confronts the unknown.

---

## Threshold Independence

Three thresholds are independent:

* **Exist** — coherent emergence.
* **Persist** — efficient maintenance under disturbance.
* **Scale** — recognition as a reusable building block at a higher layer.

A system may cross any subset without the others.

---

## Complementarity

Some thresholds cannot be crossed in isolation.

**Complementarity** is structural coupling that supplies missing degrees of freedom.

The coupled system forms a new composite execution topology.

Complementarity may enable conditional existence, partial persistence, or limited scale. It does not guarantee durability.

---

## Compression, Drift, and Redesign

Because environments drift, all compression is provisional.

Systems operate in recurring regimes:

1. optionality preservation,
2. compression (discard safe distinctions),
3. exploitation (cheap repeated execution),
4. redesign (reintroduce discarded distinctions).

Redesign authority cannot be fully expressed through settled metrics, as metrics encode the closure being revised.

Failure to redesign when error patterns violate assumed invariants is a primary collapse mode.

---

## Where Values Appear (Descriptive)

Values appear through compression decisions:

* which distinctions were discarded,
* when they were discarded,
* where redesign authority resides.

Values are not injected. They are the residue of irreversible abstraction that survived execution.

This claim is descriptive, not normative.

---

## Closing

Execution destroys information.
Topology routes consequence.
Compression enables repetition.
Closure hardens.
Metrics bind.
Agency exists only at boundaries.
Responsibility follows load.

Narratives may delay recognition.
Execution does not negotiate.

Only what executes persists.
