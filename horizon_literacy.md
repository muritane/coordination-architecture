# Horizon Literacy  
## Notes on Time-Indexed Validity, Drift, and Executable Understanding

---

## Status and Intent

This document describes **horizon literacy** as a structural capability required for
coherent action, coordination, and redesign in systems operating under:

- irreversible execution,
- bounded resources,
- environmental drift,
- and partial observability.

Horizon literacy is treated neither as:
- foresight,
- long-term planning,
- optimism or pessimism,
- nor moral seriousness,

but as a **minimal competence in reasoning about time-indexed validity**.

The perspective is **architectural and execution-oriented**, not psychological or normative.

---

## Core Claim

Most human systems are **horizon-illiterate**.

They routinely:
- treat short-horizon validity as permanent,
- treat long-horizon uncertainty as optional,
- and collapse time distinctions until failure forces them back.

Horizon literacy is the ability to **keep time explicit where it binds**,  
and implicit only where it safely does not.

---

## What Is a Horizon? (Operational)

In this document, a **horizon** refers to:

> the time span over which a representation, decision, abstraction, or coordination pattern is assumed to remain valid under execution.

A horizon is not:
- a prediction,
- a guarantee,
- or a commitment to persistence.

It is a **scope condition** on validity.

---

## Validity Is Horizon-Bound

No abstraction is valid “in general.”

Every abstraction is valid only:
- within a regime,
- under certain drift rates,
- over a bounded time span.

Outside that span:
- the abstraction may degrade,
- silently mislead,
- or catastrophically fail.

Horizon literacy begins with rejecting horizon-free claims as **underspecified**.

---

## Common Horizon Errors

### 1. Horizon Collapse

Treating:
- “works now”
as equivalent to
- “will continue to work.”

This error is cheap initially and expensive later.

---

### 2. Horizon Laundering

Implicitly extending the validity of an abstraction
by embedding it in narrative, identity, or legitimacy claims.

Examples:
- “this is how we do things,”
- “this worked before,”
- “this is standard practice.”

---

### 3. Horizon Avoidance

Refusing to specify horizons because:
- it feels pessimistic,
- it complicates coordination,
- or it threatens legitimacy.

Avoidance does not eliminate horizons.
It merely hides them.

---

### 4. Horizon Mismatch

Evaluating actions on short horizons
that destroy viability on longer ones.

This is the dominant failure mode of complex systems.

---

## Why Horizons Are Usually Implicit

Horizons are often left unstated because:

- articulation increases coordination overhead,
- most environments are locally stable,
- short horizons dominate everyday feedback,
- explicit expiration feels like weakness.

This is a rational compression—until drift makes it binding.

---

## Horizon Literacy (Operational Definition)

In this document, **horizon literacy** refers to:

> the ability of a system or agent to represent, reason about, and act upon the time-bounded validity of its own abstractions.

This includes the ability to:
- distinguish short-horizon sufficiency from long-horizon viability,
- detect when horizons are being exceeded,
- and reopen abstractions before failure hardens them.

---

## Horizons vs Goals

Horizon literacy is **orthogonal to goals**.

Two agents may share goals and still fail
because they operate on incompatible horizons.

Many coordination conflicts are not value disagreements,
but **horizon mismatches** misdiagnosed as moral or strategic ones.

---

## Horizons and Drift

Drift ensures that:
- invariants age,
- causal structures shift,
- and discarded variables re-enter relevance.

Horizon literacy does not prevent drift.

It ensures that:
- drift is expected,
- expiration is representable,
- and redesign is not treated as betrayal or failure.

---

## Horizon Encoding as a Design Choice

Systems encode horizons in many implicit ways:

- version numbers,
- maintenance cycles,
- review intervals,
- depreciation schedules,
- term limits,
- sunset clauses.

Where these are absent,
the system is silently assuming **infinite horizon validity**.

That assumption is almost always false.

---

## Explicit vs Implicit Horizons

Not all horizons need to be explicit.

Horizon literacy requires only that:
- horizons are explicit **where they bind**,
- and recoverable where they do not.

Making everything explicit is unexecutable.
Making nothing explicit is brittle.

---

## Horizons and Redesign Capability

Redesign is possible only if:
- expiration can be represented,
- interruption is executable,
- and responsibility does not collapse into blame.

Horizon literacy preserves **redesign reachability**
by preventing abstractions from becoming timeless.

---

## Social Costs of Horizon Literacy

Horizon literacy introduces friction because it:

- weakens permanence narratives,
- challenges identity-coupled practices,
- disrupts short-horizon incentives,
- reduces symbolic certainty.

These costs explain why horizon literacy is rare,
not why it is wrong.

---

## Horizon Literacy vs Long-Termism

Horizon literacy does **not** mean:

- always optimizing for the longest horizon,
- sacrificing the present for the future,
- or treating near-term concerns as trivial.

It means:
- knowing which horizon currently binds,
- and not pretending others do not exist.

---

## Why Horizon Literacy Matters Now

As drift accelerates across:
- technology,
- institutions,
- environments,
- and coordination systems,

horizon errors become:
- more frequent,
- more coupled,
- and more catastrophic.

Horizon literacy shifts failure from:
- sudden collapse,
to:
- earlier redesign pressure.

---

## Minimal Indicators of Horizon Literacy

A system exhibits horizon literacy when it can say:

- “This holds until X.”
- “Beyond Y, this abstraction degrades.”
- “We do not know the horizon here.”
- “This requires redesign, not justification.”
- “Expiration does not imply blame.”

These statements are rare.
They are also sufficient.

---

## Closing

Horizon literacy is not wisdom.

It is not foresight.
It is not caution.
It is not optimism or pessimism.

It is simply **honesty about time**.

Any system that executes under drift
will eventually be forced to learn it.

The only question is whether it learns:
- early, cheaply, and explicitly,
or:
- late, expensively, and through failure.
