# Decidability and Agency in Load-Bearing Systems

## Field Notes on Boundary Consent, Topological Entry, and Binding Participation

---

## Status

This document presents a **structural account of agency** in load-bearing systems.

Agency is treated as a **topological property of boundary decisions**, not as:
- a psychological trait,
- an expression of preference,
- a moral quality,
- or a claim about intent or virtue.

The account is **descriptive and architectural**, not normative.

---

## What This Document Is

This document defines **agency** as:

> the capacity to make a *binding yes/no decision* at the boundary of a load-bearing substrate, thereby accepting or refusing the interfaces, invariants, routing rules, buffers, and failure semantics implied by participation.

It focuses on:
- decidability at entry,
- binding consequences of participation,
- legitimacy of responsibility assignment,
- and the difference between execution and negotiation.

---

## What This Document Is Not

This document does **not**:

- claim all participation is voluntary,
- justify existing power structures,
- moralize compliance or refusal,
- deny coercion or asymmetry,
- equate consent with fairness,
- or assert that exit is always possible.

It does not argue that systems are just.
It argues that **binding requires a real boundary decision**.

---

## Core Claim

In load-bearing systems, **agency exists at boundaries, not inside execution**.

Once an agent crosses a boundary and enters a load-bearing substrate:

- interpretation terminates,
- invariants apply,
- routing rules hold,
- buffers are owned,
- refusal semantics are fixed.

Inside execution, agency is not reinterpretation.
It is **execution under declared constraints**.

---

## Decidability as the Minimal Form of Agency

Agency, in this framework, reduces to **decidability**:

- the ability to say **yes**,
- the ability to say **no**,
- with known and bounded consequences for each.

Anything less is not agency.
Anything more is exploration or negotiation.

A decision is *not* decidable if:
- refusal carries unbounded cost,
- consequences are undefined,
- interfaces are implicit,
- or obligations are revealed only after entry.

---

## Participation as Topological Binding

To participate in a substrate is to bind oneself to:

- specific interfaces,
- enforced invariants,
- declared inputs and outputs,
- explicit buffer ownership,
- authority and escalation paths,
- known failure and refusal semantics.

This binding is **structural**, not interpersonal.

Participation is a contract with the **topology**, not with individual actors.

---

## Hardware as the Canonical Example

A hardware component illustrates this clearly:

- A RAM module chooses a standard (e.g. DDR4, DDR5).
- By doing so, it accepts:
  - voltage levels,
  - timing constraints,
  - signaling protocols,
  - error behavior,
  - compatibility limits.

The act of insertion is the act of agency.

After insertion:
- renegotiation is impossible,
- reinterpretation is invalid,
- refusal manifests as non-function.

This is not punishment.
It is **topological incompatibility**.

---

## Markets and Institutions as Substrates

Markets, standards bodies, and institutions function the same way when hygienic.

To participate, an actor accepts:
- specification requirements,
- compliance thresholds,
- liability assignment,
- buffer ownership (inventory, time, capital),
- evaluation and refusal mechanisms.

When these are explicit:
- entry is meaningful,
- responsibility is legible,
- failure is localized.

When they are implicit:
- agency is retroactively asserted,
- responsibility is moralized,
- buffers are silently captured.

---

## False Agency Patterns

The concept of agency is commonly misused in two structural ways:

### 1. Post-Hoc Reinterpretation

> “I agreed, but not to *this* consequence.”

This is valid only in exploratory regimes.

In load-bearing execution, this is a denial of topology.
It attempts to reopen interpretation after invariants apply.

---

### 2. Coerced Entry Disguised as Choice

> “You are free to refuse, but refusal carries unlimited penalty.”

This is not agency.
It is forced participation with moral cover.

Systems that rely on this pattern are **unhygienic**.

---

## Responsibility Without Moralization

Under this model:

- responsibility is not blame,
- responsibility is **load location**.

If an agent:
- explicitly entered,
- with declared interfaces,
- and known buffers,

then assigning responsibility is structural, not moral.

If an agent:
- never had a real refusal option,
- or entered under misrepresented constraints,

then responsibility was misrouted.

---

## Exit, Versioning, and Temporal Agency

True agency requires not only entry, but **bounded exit or versioning**.

Healthy systems declare:
- compatibility horizons,
- end-of-life timelines,
- migration paths,
- scope of obligation over time.

Without this:
- consent becomes permanent,
- participation becomes entrapment,
- topology fossilizes.

Versioning is what preserves agency across time.

---

## Relationship to Constraint Discovery

Constraint discovery explains:
- when invariants become unavoidable,
- why execution hardens,
- how load reveals limits.

This document explains:
- who is legitimately bound by those invariants,
- and under what conditions responsibility assignment is valid.

Constraint discovery without decidability produces coercion.
Decidability without constraint discovery produces illusion.

---

## Summary (Compressed)

- Agency is boundary decidability.
- Participation is binding to topology.
- Inside execution, reinterpretation is invalid.
- Responsibility follows declared entry.
- Refusal must be real to ground consent.
- Versioning preserves agency over time.
- Moral language often substitutes for missing boundaries.

## Closing Note

Agency is not freedom from constraint.

It is the freedom to choose **which constraints to bind oneself to**,  
and the honesty of systems in declaring what that choice entails.

Load-bearing systems do not eliminate agency.  
They require it to be **explicit, bounded, and topologically real**.
